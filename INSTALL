Brief Instructions

   $ ./configure --help
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make install


   Edit the /usr/local/etc/freetds.conf file to add servers.
   Test the connection with /usr/local/bin/tsql.
   Build and test the package that requires FreeTDS.

   If you want to build the ODBC driver, you'll probably first want to install
   a Driver Manager (on Unix-like systems).  This release of FreeTDS was tested
   with unixODBC 2.2.11.

   For any other information please see the Users Guide.
