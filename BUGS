Recently Fixed
--------------
1. Bug under SQL 7 with large (> 512 bytes) queries.  (default block size
   is changed by the server)
2. ct_cancel/dbcancel doesn't work right
3. Negative smallmoney values not working
4. change in dbsqlexec has broken query pending client msg under dblib
5. Core dump on failed login see dblib/unittests/t0001
   (return from dbproc() not checked, but should it coredump?)
6. make clean doesn't do obdc or unittests directories
7. make dist doesn't work right.
8. Check int sizes in autoconf
9. 20030123 make distclean doesn't handle unittest directories.
10. 20030123 Stored procedure return statuses not propagated


Believed Fixed
--------------
1. missing digit on numeric/float types under some clients
2. text values getting truncated to 255 bytes under TDS 7. (can someone
   provide more detail?)
3. code to send COL_NAME and COL_INFO tokens are not in the server stuff.
4. tds_get_*int() and tds_put_*int() should handle either endianess on any 
   platform. Breaks TDS 7.0 under big end machines.

Needs Fixing
------------
1. Text values not being handled for ctlib/dblib, tds works
   (I think dblib works, but ctlib needs work)
2. Fix formatting of dbprhead/dbprrow...its a little off
   (Anybody care?)
4. text/image does not work for row buffering under dblib.
5. Intermittant crash with PHP apache module. (Unknown marker messages
   appear in the log...)
6. dbwritetext() and friends do not work under TDS 7.0
7. There is a bug with the order of returns from ct_results() such that rows
   affected doesn't show up in sqsh.
8. dbsqlexec() needs a dbresults() loop on error and shouldn't
9. freetds.conf requires server names to be lower case.

Reported but not confirmed
--------------------------
1. Insert/Update queries reported not to work on TDS 7. (couldn't confirm)
