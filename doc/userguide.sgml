			<para>
This User Guide describes <productname>FreeTDS</productname> 0.64.  It is the product of (lots of) happy collaborative effort.  Although Brian's name and mine are at the top of it, behind it are many others, who contributed thoughtful suggestions, bamboozled questions, stellar prose, and terse instructions.  I don't mention this for the usual reasons (the enumeration of which I leave to you) but rather to emphasize that the purpose of our effort is to help you and those who come after you to have the easiest and most enjoyable time with <productname>FreeTDS</productname>.

It is surprisingly hard, after a while, to remember how it can be for someone newly approaching a project to use it.  What seems as obvious as a fog horn to an old hand may be much more like the fog itself to the newcomer.  That can make installing and setting up new software a puzzling or frustrating experience.  You may have heard, <quote>It's easy if you know how.</quote>  Indeed it is, and that's our purpose here: to make it easy, by letting you know how.

		<title>What is <productname>FreeTDS</productname>?</title>

		<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> is an open source (or free software if you prefer) programming library, a re-implementation of the Tabular Data Stream protocol.  It can be used in place of Sybase's <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> or <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> libraries.  It also includes an <systemitem class="library">ODBC library</systemitem>.  It allows many open source applications such as <productname>Perl</productname> and <productname>PHP</productname> (or your own C or C++ program) to connect to Sybase or Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname>.   
		</para>
		<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> is distributed in source code form, and is expected to compile on just about any operating system.  That means every form of Unix&reg; and Unix-like&trade; system (including notable variants such as Interix&reg; and QNX&reg;), as well as Win32&reg;, VMS&reg;, and OS X&reg;.  If it doesn't compile on your system &mdash; and you're not using MS-DOS&reg; &mdash; it's probably considered a bug.  
		</para>
		<sect1 id="tdsprotocolhist">
			<title>Background: The <acronym>TDS</> Protocol
				and related <acronym>API</>s
			</title>
			<para>
<acronym>TDS</> is a <firstterm>protocol</firstterm>, a set of rules describing how to transmit data between two computers.  Like any protocol, it defines the types of messages that can be sent, and the order in which they may be sent.  Protocols describe the <quote>bits on the wire</quote>, how data flow.  
			</para>
			<para>
In reading this manual, it may be helpful to keep in mind that a protocol is not an <acronym>API</>, although the two are related.  The server recognizes and speaks a protocol; anything that can send it the correct combination of bytes in the right order can communicate with it.  But programmers aren't generally in the business of sending bytes; that's the job of a library.  Over the years, there have been a few libraries &mdash; each with its own <acronym>API</> &mdash; that do the work of moving SQL through a <acronym>TDS</> pipe.  <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, and  <acronym>JDBC</> have very different <acronym>API</>s, but they're all one to the server, because on the wire they speak <acronym>TDS</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
The <acronym>TDS</> protocol was designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase <productname>SQL Server</productname> relational database engine in 1984.  The problem Sybase faced then still exists: There was no commonly accepted application-level protocol to transfer data between a database server and its client.  To encourage the use of their product, Sybase came up with a flexible pair of products called <productname>netlib</productname> and <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>.
  			</para>
			<para>
<productname>netlib</productname>'s job was to ferry data between the two computers.  To do that, it had to deal with the underlying network protocol.  Remember, in those days <acronym>TCP/IP</> was not the ubiquitous thing it is today.  Besides <acronym>TCP/IP</>, <productname>netlib</productname> ran on <acronym>DECnet</>, <acronym>IPX/SPX</>, <acronym>NetBEUI</> and the like.   
			</para>
			<para>
<systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> provided an <acronym>API</> to the client program, and communicated with the server via <productname>netlib</productname>.  What <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> sent to the server took the form of a stream of bytes, a structured stream of bytes meant for tables of data, a Tabular Data Stream.  
			</para>
			<para>
In 1990 Sybase entered into a technology sharing agreement with Microsoft which resulted in Microsoft marketing its own <productname>SQL Server</productname>. Microsoft kept the <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</> and added <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem>.  (Microsoft has since added other <acronym>API</>s, too.)

At about the same time, Sybase introduced a more powerful <quote>successor</quote> to <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, called <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, and called the pair <productname><firstterm>OpenClient</firstterm></productname>.  
			</para>
			<para>

<systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, and <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> are <acronym>API</>s that &mdash; however different their programming style may be &mdash; all use <productname>netlib</productname> to communicate to the server.  The language they use is <acronym>TDS</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
The <acronym>TDS</> protocol comes in several flavors, most of which have never
been openly documented.  If anything, it's probably considered to be something like a trade secret, or at least proprietary technology.  The exception is TDS 5.0, used exclusively by Sybase, for which documentation is available <ulink url="http://crm.sybase.com/sybase/www/ESD/tds_spec_download.jsp">from Sybase</ulink>.

		<sect1 id="tdshistory">
			<title>History of <acronym>TDS</> Versions</title>
			
			<para>
At first, there was One Version of <acronym>TDS</> common to both vendors, but in keeping with the broad history of private ventures, they soon diverged. Each vendor has subsequently brought out different versions, and neither supports the other's flavor. That is to say, each vendor's client libraries use the latest version of <acronym>TDS</> offered by that vendor.  You can't reliably use Microsoft's libraries to connect to Sybase, or Sybase's libraries to connect to Microsoft.  In some cases you'll get a connection, but pretty soon you'll bump into some incompatibility.

			<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> was and is developed by observation and experimentation, which is to say, by trial and error.  
			</para>
			<para>
In early 1997, the only option for connecting to a Sybase server from Linux or other free systems was an aging Sybase-released version of <productname>OpenClient</productname>.  Unfortunately it had a few problems.  The original release was a.out based, although Greg Thain did a great service in converting the library to ELF.  Secondly, it included only the newer <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>.  The older <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</> was missing.
			</para>
			<para>
Brian Bruns, a Sybase DBA and originator of the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> project, had some <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> programs he wanted to run under Linux, and thus began the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> project. The original work focused on <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> and version 5.0 of the protocol, but quickly expanded to include a <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> compatible layer and <acronym>TDS</> version 4.2.  Later support for <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> and <acronym>TDS 7.0 and 8.0</> was added. Craig Spannring wrote a Java  <acronym>JDBC</> driver which became <productname>FreeTDS/JDBC</productname>.
			</para>
			<para>
As the project matured, it gained new partcipants.  Frediano Ziglio greatly expanded the <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> driver, and continues to improve both it and the underlying TDS library.  Bill Thompson wrote most of the present BCP system and added cursors to our <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>.  Your humble author joined the project to add documentation, and wound up as the project's maintainer.  Such are the rewards for doing a good deed.

			<title>Status</title>
			<para>
The <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> and <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>s have been usable for several years.  They have been successfully  substituted for Sybase's own libraries in a variety of venues, including <productname>Perl</productname> and <productname>PHP</productname>.  That is not to say that these drivers are complete; they're not.  But they faithfully implement an important subset of their <acronym>API</>s, enough to be useful.  This 0.64 version boasts support for server-side cursors in <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>.  
			</para>
			<para>
In addition to the core <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname>  includes a full implementation of <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>'s <acronym>bcp</> functions, as well as <command>freebcp</>, a replacement for Sybase's <application>bcp</application> utility.  
			</para>
			<para>
The <systemitem class="library">ODBC</> driver is younger, but has received much attention.  
The <productname>FreeTDS</productname> 0.60 ODBC driver was a vast improvement over earlier versions, and 0.61 began to comply with the ODBC 3.0 specification.
The current version should be fully ODBC 3.0 compatible and contain many fixes and improvements (<systemitem class="library">ODBC</>  <acronym>RPC</> parameters, descriptors and others).  Any problems found in the currently implemented <acronym>API</> subset are cheerfully  addressed.  
			</para>
			<para>
Basic <link linkend="apireference">API coverage</link> information for all libraries may be found in this manual.  It is maintained in <filename>doc/api_status.txt</>, included in the source distribution.   			
			</para> 
			<para>How big is it?  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has over 90,000 lines of C code, maintained by a handful of developers.  Patches arrive irregularly, varying in size from one-liners to thousand-line monsters.  Almost all are applied or used in some way.  The mailing list has some 700 or so subscribers at this writing.  Safe to say, <productname>FreeTDS</productname>'s success so far lies somewhere between the Beetle and the Edsel.  
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="Languages">
			<title>Languages besides C and Java</title>
			<para>
You may be wondering how these libraries fit with Perl, PHP, TCL, Python, or other popular scripting languages.  Most of these languages have bindings to Sybase that use either the <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> or <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>, for which <productname>FreeTDS</productname> is intended as a drop-in replacement.  For instance, Michael Peppler's <systemitem class="library">DBD::Sybase</systemitem> works very well using <productname>FreeTDS</productname> to access Sybase or Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname>s.  <productname>PHP</productname> has options for <filename>sybase</filename> (<systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>) and <filename>sybase-ct</filename> (<systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>) <acronym>API</>s.
			</para>
			<para>
Not to be outdone, the folks at the <firstterm>O'Caml</> project have a binding for that language.  You can read more about it on <ulink url="http://kenn.frap.net/ocaml-freetds/">

	<para>If you intend to build the <productname>FreeTDS</> ODBC driver &mdash; and want to use a Driver Manager (DM), as most people do &mdash; install the Driver Manager before configuring <productname>FreeTDS</>.  <Command>configure</> will detect the the DM and use its header (<filename>.h</>) files for ODBC constants and such.  If your DM is installed in an unusual directory, you may have to provide the directory name as a parameter to <Command>configure</>.</para>
	
	<para><productname>FreeTDS</> doesn't <emphasis>require</> a DM.  You can build the ODBC driver without one, as long as you have the requisite header files: <filename>sql.h</>, <filename>sqlext.h</> and <filename>sqltypes.h</>.  These can be taken from either the iODBC or UnixODBC distributions. Put them wherever you like (e.g.,  <filename>/usr/local/include</filename>).  Because <productname>FreeTDS</> won't detect your (missing) DM, it won't automatically build the ODBC driver, so you'll have to tell <Command>configure</> what to do and where to look.  Cf. <link linkend="withOdbcNoDM"><option>--with-odbc-nodm</></link> <option</>.

Why downgrade your protocol?  If you encounter a bug, reverting to 4.2 can help isolate it.  If you're using low-bandwidth connections, 4.2 is faster than 7.0, because 7.0 transfers all character data in UCS-2 (unicode, 2 bytes/character).  
However TDS 4.2 has many limitations (see below).  If you encounter problems, please report them to the mailing list.

<literal>[global]</literal> section,  and one <literal>[<replaceable>dataserver</replaceable>]</literal> section for each dataserver.  Settings in the <literal>[global]</literal> section affect all dataservers, but can be overridden in a <literal>[<replaceable>dataserver</replaceable>]</literal> section.  For example

	port = 1433

[myserver2]
	host = unixbox.mydomain.com

</programlisting>
</example>
	<para>
In this example, the default  <acronym>TDS</> version for all dataservers is set to <literal>4.2</>.  It is then overridden for <literal>myserver2</literal> (a Sybase server) which uses <literal>5.0</>.
	</para>
	<para>
Usually, it is sufficient to state the only server's hostname and TDS protocol.  Everything else can be inferred, unless your setup (or your server's) strays from the defaults.  
	<tip><para>Some people seem to feel safer using the IP address for the server, rather than its name.  We don't recommend you do that.  Use the name, and benefit from the inherent advantages.  That's why DNS was invented in the first place, you know, and you normally <emphasis>should</> be able to find your server by its name.  Beyond that, if you do use a number, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will ask DNS for that number's name (a <firstterm>reverse lookup</>).  A properly configured DNS will execute a reverse lookup just as fast as a forward lookup, but not every DNS is properly configured.  If yours isn't, you'll wait awhile, unless you take evasive action.  </para></tip>
	</para>
	<para>
It bears mentioning here that prior versions of <productname>FreeTDS</productname> were quite fussy about domain logins, forcing users to make explicit per-server entries in <filename>freetds.conf</>.  That is no longer the case.  If the username has the form <parameter>DOMAIN\username</>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will automatically use a domain login.

The unit tests rely on the <filename>PWD</> file in root of the FreeTDS source tree.  
<filename>PWD</> holds a username, password, servername, and database to be used for the unit tests.  We try to make sure to leave nothing behind: any data and objects created are either temporary or removed at the end of the test.  The tests should all work, subject to disclaimers in the directory's <filename>README</>.  			</para>
			<para>
To invoke the tests, edit the <filename>PWD</> file and issue the command <command>make check</command>.  In order to execute all tests successfully, you must indicate a working, available dataserver in <filename>PWD</>.
Some tests require permission to create stored procedures on server.
			</para>
			<para>
To complete successfully, the ODBC tests require some additional setup.  In your <filename>PWD</> file, add a <literal>SRV</> entry specifying the DSN entry for your <filename>odbc.ini</>.  The ODBC tests all build their own <filename>odbc.ini</> and try to redirect the Driver Manager to it, however this functionality is very DM dependent and may well fail unless you have either iODBC or unixODBC.
			</para>
			<para>
As of version 0.63 you may experience problems running tests under Mac OS X because the executable cannot find some library.  Setting <envar>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</> environment variable to point to your compiler libraries usually seems to fix the problem.

			<para>
To connect to a database, a library such as <productname>FreeTDS</> needs some information about the connection.  Which server, and by <emphasis>server</>, which IP address and port is do you mean?  Which user is requesting the connection, and what authentication does he offer?  Every database library needs a way to capture and convey that information.  
			</para>
			<para>
ODBC was conceived as a general interface definition, not tied to any particular database or access library.  For that reason, ODBC also needs to know which driver to use with a given server.  
			</para>
			<para>
The original ODBC solution to this conundrum employed the <filename>odbc.ini</> file.  <filename>odbc.ini</> stored information about a server, known generically as a <firstterm>Data Source Name</> (DSN).  ODBC applications connected to the server by calling the function <function>SQLConnect(DSN, UID, PWD)</function>, where <replaceable>DSN</> is the Data Source Name entry in <filename>odbc.ini</>, <replaceable>UID</> is the username, and <replaceable>PWD</> the password. Any and all information about the DSN was kept in <filename>odbc.ini</>.  And all was right with the world.  
			</para>
			<para>
The ODBC 3.0 specification introduced a new function: <function>SQLDriverConnect</>. 
The connection attributes are provided as a single argument, a string of concatenated name-value pairs.  <function>SQLDriverConnect</> subsumed the functionality of <function>SQLConnect</>, in that the name-value pair string allowed the caller to pass &mdash;  in addition the the original <literal>DSN</>, <literal>UID</>, and <literal>PWD</> &mdash; any other parameters the driver could accept. Moreover, the application can specify which driver to use.  In effect, it became possible to specify the entire set of DSN properties as parameters to <function>SQLDriverConnect</>, obviating the need for <filename>odbc.ini</>.  This led to the use of the so-called <firstterm>DSN-less</> configuration, a setup with no <filename>odbc.ini</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
But <productname>FreeTDS</> did not start out as an ODBC driver (remember db-lib and ct-lib), and has always had its own way to store server properties: <filename>freetds.conf</>.  When Brian added the <productname>FreeTDS</> ODBC driver, he began by supporting the old <function>SQLConnect</>, using <filename>odbc.ini</> to describe the DSN.  That choice complied with the expectations of the Driver Managers, and minimized the amount of duplicated information in the configuration files.  But it can be a little confusing, too, because <filename>odbc.ini</> in effect points to <filename>freetds.conf</>.  We call this configuration <firstterm>ODBC-combined</>, because it supports all three <productname>FreeTDS</> libraries.  
			</para>
			<para>
With version 0.60, the <productname>FreeTDS</> ODBC library started to see a fuller implementation. The driver was changed to be able to read the connection attributes directly from <filename>odbc.ini</>, rather than leaning on <filename>freetds.conf</>.  For installations that don't need db-lib and ct-lib, this <firstterm>ODBC-only</> setup is simpler.  			</para>
			<para>
More recently, <function>SQLDriverConnect</> was added to <productname>FreeTDS</>.  As described above, this function allows the application to specify connection attributes with reference to either, or neither, configuration file.  It's your choice.  In making that choice, keep the following terms clear in your mind:

In a DSN-less configuration, the <filename>odbc.ini</filename> file is not consulted for server connection properties.

			<title>Big Endian Clients with Buggy <productname>SQL Server</productname>s</title>
			<para>
Several version of Microsoft SQL server have a bug that affects big endian clients.  This includes 7.0 GA and 7.0 SP1.  Furthermore, <acronym>TDS</> Protocol version 7.0 is natively little endian. <productname>SQL Server 2000</productname> is also reported not to work from big endian clients without little endian emulation turned on.
			</para>
<Note><para>If you are unfamiliar with the terms <emphasis>big endian</emphasis> and <emphasis>little endian</emphasis>, they are terms that come originally from Gullivers Travels.  What they refer to in computer science is the the order in which bytes are stored by a processor.  Big endian machines such as Sparc and PowerPC store the most significant byte in the first memory location of a multi-byte integer.  Little endian machines such as Intel and Alpha do it the other way around.  So the 16-bit number 258 would be 0x0102 on big endian and 0x0201 on little endian machines.</para></Note>

<para>
In this example we want to force connections to a server named <literal>mssql</literal> to emulate a little endian client.  We are using protocol version 4.2 here, version 7.0 and 8.0 will automatically emulate little endian mode regardless of the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> setting.
<emphasis>You shouldn't use this option, set another protocol version instead (7.0 or 8.0)</emphasis>.

			<title><acronym>TDS</> 7.0 for Nonwestern Languages</title>
			<para>
<acronym>TDS</> 7.0 uses 2-byte Unicode (technically, <acronym>UCS-2</>) to transfer character data between servers and clients.  Included in <quote>character data</quote> are query text (i.e., <acronym>SQL</>), metadata (table names and such), and <foreignphrase>bona fide</> data of datatypes <literal>nchar</>, <literal>nvarchar</>, and <literal>ntext</>.
			</para>
			<para>
Since most Unix tools and languages do not support <acronym>UCS-2</>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> allows conversion by the client to other character sets using the <ulink url="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/iconv.html">iconv</ulink> standard.  Background information on Unicode and how it affects <productname>FreeTDS</productname> can be found in the <link linkend="Unicode">appendix</link>.  If no iconv library is found, or if it is explicitly disabled, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will use its built-in iconv substitute, and will be capable of converting between only <acronym>ISO-8859-1</> and <acronym>UCS-2</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
To learn what character set the client is using, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> examines the <link linkend="clientcharset"><filename>freetds.conf</></link> entry.  If it finds nothing there, it assumes the client is using <acronym>ISO-8859-1</>.   That is generally a safe assumption for western languages such as English or French, but produces garbage for other languages.

</programlisting>
</example>
			<para>
If <productname>FreeTDS</productname> runs into a character it can not convert, its behavior varies according to the severity of the problem.  On retrieving data from the server, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> substitutes an <acronym>ASCII</> '?' in the character's place, and emits a warning message stating that some characters could not be converted.  On sending data to the server, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> aborts the query and emits an error message.  It is well to ensure that the data contained in the database is representable in the client's character set.</para>

			<para>
If you have a mix of character data that can not be contained in a single byte character set, you may wish to use <acronym>UTF-8</>.  <acronym>UTF-8</> is a variable length unicode encoding that is compatible with <acronym>ASCII</> in the range 0 to 127.  With <acronym>UTF-8</>, you are guaranteed to never have an unconvertible character.</para>

<Important><para><productname>FreeTDS</productname> is not fully compatible with multi-byte character sets such as <acronym>UCS-2</>.  You must use an ASCII-extension charset (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-*)<footnote><para>not EBCDIC or other weird charsets</para></footnote>. Extreme care should be taken with testing applications using these encodings. Specifically, many applications do not expect the number of characters returned to exceed the column size (in bytes).  On the other hand, support of <acronym>UTF-8</> and <acronym>UCS-2</> is a high priority for the developers.  Patches and bug reports in this area are especially welcome.  
</para></Important>

In the following example, a server named <literal>mssql</literal> will return data encoded in the <acronym>UTF-8</> character set.

			<title>Implementation details</title>

Support for domain logins in <productname>FreeTDS</productname> is limited to the TCP/IP network protocol stack.   <productname>FreeTDS</productname> does not currently implement support for Named Pipe-based SQL connections &mdash; that is, connections transported over the DCE/RPC interface, which uses TCP port 139, 445, or 135 on Win32 machines depending on the type of encapsulation used for DCE/RPC itself. Supporting this would require a fairly extensive DCE/RPC library for Unix.   <productname>Samba</productname> has one that is licensed under the GPL and therefore not usable by LGPL-licenced projects such as <productname>FreeTDS</productname> . 
			</para>
			<para>
Your domain controller must allow authentication over TCP/IP, or you will be unable to log in.  One symptom of a server that requires Named Pipes for authentication is an error message such as:

When running <productname>FreeTDS</productname> with applications such as <productname>Apache</productname>/PHP it is often difficult to get a usable log file.  Since each of the many httpd children opens the file at the beginning of its connection and closes it on connection close, they tend to stomp all over each other.

<application>SQSH</application> is a command line based query tool written by Scott Gray to replace the <command>isql</> utility that ships with <productname>Sybase ASE</productname>.  It makes a great diagnostic tool for <productname>FreeTDS</productname> as well.

#  The following set of CT-LIB libraries were determined automatically
#  by 'configure'.  For most systems configure looks up the required
#  libraries by looking at the name of the OS (although this doesn't
#  mean it got them right), however if the line below ends with the
#  word "Guess", then 'configure' didn't have an entry for your operating
#  system and it took a best guess to figure out which libraries you
#  need. In either case, there may be problems, so look this line over
#  and if it doesn't work, compare it to the libraries located in
#  $SYBASE/samples/ct-library.
#
#  The listings below show suggested libraries for Operating Systems
#  that frequently fail to be recognized by 'configure':
#
#  SCO:   -lblk -lct -lcs -lcomn -ltcl -ltli -lnsl_s -lintl -m -lsocket

			<para>
Option 2 is to use the <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>.  Again here, we run into minor difficulties at build time.  Applications linking with Sybase's OpenClient have to link in a handful of libraries and these libraries vary slightly from platform to platform.  When creating <productname>FreeTDS</productname> it was decided that there would be only one library: <filename>libct</filename>.  This saves a great deal of library naming conflicts that Sybase ran into (e.g. <filename>libtcl</filename> is used both by Sybase and the language TCL), however some applications like PHP assume that all the Sybase libraries will be present. So, some hand editing of the Makefile is necessary to remove these extra libs.  Build <productname>FreeTDS</productname> just as you would for <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> in 
<link linkend="phpDblib"> with <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem></link>, above. Then configure PHP with <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd php</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-sybase-ct=/usr/local/freetds</userinput>
</screen>
Now edit the <filename>Zend/Makefile</filename> looking for the <literal>libZend_la_LDFLAGS</literal> line and remove <literal>-lsybtcl -lintl -lcomn</literal> and <literal>-lcs</literal>, leaving the <literal>-lct</literal>. Then proceed to make and install PHP.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>su root</userinput>
<prompt>Password: </prompt>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput>

We hope an upcoming version of PHP will automatically detect the presence of <productname>FreeTDS</productname> and include only the <literal>-lct</literal> library.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="ODBC">
			<title><systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem></title>
			<para>
The third and newest option is to use the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> driver with PHP.  First build the <productname>iODBC</productname> or <productname>unixODBC</productname> driver manager and <productname>FreeTDS</productname> as detailed <link linkend="prepodbc">in this guide</link>.  Then build PHP with support for ODBC.

			</para>
			<para>
<productname>SybSQL</productname> has a fairly basic build process that simply uses a Makefile.  In order for <productname>SybSQL</productname> to find <productname>Qt</productname> and <productname>FreeTDS</productname> you need to define <envar>QTDIR</envar> and <envar>SYBASE</envar> environment variables.  If you have <productname>Qt</productname> installed, you may have <envar>QTDIR</envar> defined already.  To verify, type <command>echo $QTDIR</command> at the shell prompt.  This example uses my own installation path of <filename>qt-2.3.1</filename> (from RedHat 7.2), YMMV.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-2.3.1</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export SYBASE=/usr/local</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput>
</screen>
When finished you'll have an executable named <filename>sybsql</filename> that you can run.  
			</para>
			<para>
One caveat to the way in which <productname>SybSQL</productname> and <productname>FreeTDS</productname> interact is that <productname>SybSQL</productname> expects to be running under <productname>OpenClient</productname>, and makes the assumption that a valid <envar>$SYBASE</envar><filename>/interfaces</filename> file exists.  Since <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has deprecated use of the <filename>interfaces</filename> file in favor of the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> config file, a slight work around is required.
			</para>
			<para>
In <productname>FreeTDS</productname>'s <filename>bin</filename> directory, there is a script, <filename>conf2interfaces</filename>, to convert the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> file back into an <filename>interfaces</filename> file.  Running this, you may convert your <filename>freetds.conf</filename> into a old-style <filename>interfaces</filename> file to make <productname>SybSQL</productname> happy.  For instance,
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>mkdir ~/freetds</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>conf2interfaces /usr/local/etc/freetds.conf > ~/freetds/interfaces</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export SYBASE=~/freetds</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>sybsql</userinput>
</screen>
By defining <envar>SYBASE</envar> to the parent directory of the <filename>interfaces</filename> file, you may put it where ever you like; it does not have to be in <filename>/usr/local</filename>.  When using <filename>freetds.conf</filename>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> does not rely on the <envar>SYBASE</envar> variable for finding its own components, so it is safe to point it elsewhere.

			<para>
Questions sometimes arise over large <type>varchar</type> types (anything larger than <type>varchar(255)</type>) that became available with Microsoft <productname>SQL Server 7.0</productname>.  When accessing long <type>varchar</type>s with <acronym>TDS</> protocol version 4.2 or 5.0, these fields will be truncated to 255 characters, due to limitations inherent in the protocol definition.  Your best bet in that case is to convert them to <type>text</type> types.  
			</para>
			<para>
In Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname> 7.0 and later, <structname>varchar</structname> types can hold up to 8000 bytes (8000 <acronym>ASCII</> characters or 4000 Unicode characters).  To move these large <structname>varchar</structname>s through <acronym>TDS</> 4.2, convert them with either a <command>CONVERT</command> as in, 
<screen>
<userinput>SELECT mycol = convert(mycol, text) FROM mytable</userinput> </screen>
or with the newer SQL92 <command>CAST</command> syntax e.g., 
<screen>
<userinput>SELECT CAST(mycol as TEXT) FROM mytable</userinput></screen>
			</para>
			<para>
A related problem is that some people have reported problems with <type>text</type> field using <acronym>TDS</> version 7.0.  One known workaround is to convert long strings to <type>varchar(8000)</type> in your query text with <command>CAST( <parameter>variable_name</parameter> as <type>varchar</type>(8000) ) as <parameter>variable_name</parameter></command>.  Text datatype handling is fixed in <productname>FreeTDS</productname> 0.60, except for bcp operations.  
			</para>
			<para>
There is also a bug (<quote>Lions and tigers and bugs!  Oh, my!</quote>) in Microsoft's implementation of <type>text</type> fields.  Disregardless [sic] of their documentation, you must explicitly set the value of <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar>, else the text fields will be represented to have a maximum size of 4 gigabytes or so.  The usual manifestation is some sort of spurious <quote>out of memory</quote> error or segment fault.  To avoid this, set <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar> to some reasonable value before querying any <type>TEXT</type> fields.  For example, in <application>isql</application>:
<screen>
<prompt>1></prompt><userinput>set <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar> 10000</userinput>
<prompt>2></prompt><userinput>go</userinput>

the logs tend to grow large, so trim or archive them often.  Secondly,

	<Appendix id="interfacesfile"><title>The <filename>interfaces</filename> File</title>
			<Abstract><para>The <filename>interfaces</filename> file is retained for compatibility with Sybase environments.  It is recommended that new users use the <link linkend="freetdsconf">freetds.conf</link> format instead.</para></Abstract>
		<sect1 id="interfacesorigin">
			<title>Where it came from</title>
			<para>
Under Sybase OpenClient there is a file called <filename>interfaces</filename> that defines servers available to the software.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> inherited this file structure with minor alterations.  The <filename>interfaces</filename> remains supported for backward compatibility, and for those running in a mixed <productname>FreeTDS</productname>/Sybase environment.
			</para>
			<para>
The <filename>interfaces</filename> is not read by <productname>FreeTDS</productname> unless it does not find <filename>freetds.conf</filename>.  Note also that <command>make install</command> will install a skeleton <filename>freetds.conf</filename>, which you'll have to remove if you want to use <filename>interfaces</filename> instead.  
			</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="interfaceslocation">
			<title>Where it goes</title>
			<para>
Anywhere.  The <envar>SYBASE</envar> environment variable must contain the location of  <filename>interfaces</filename>; that is how <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will find it.  
			</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="interfacespurpose">
			<title>What it does</title>
			<para>
The <filename>interfaces</filename> file aliases a dataserver name to the hostname and port number of the dataserver's machine.  When <productname>FreeTDS</productname> receives a request to connect to a database server, it looks up the dataserver name in <filename>interfaces</filename>.  There, it finds the machine name (or address) and port number to connect to, that is, the port where the database server is listening.  
			</para>

			<tip><sidebar><title>How's that again?</title>
			<para>
The <filename>interfaces</filename> file sometimes trips people up.  It seems innocuous enough, but it's also a pretty good example of <quote>it's easy if you know how</quote>.  Keep in mind:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
				<listitem><para>The <emphasis>dataserver name</emphasis> is the name of the database server.  When a database client specifies the <quote>name of the server</quote> to connect to, it's the <emphasis>dataserver name</emphasis> that is used.  
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>The <emphasis>host name</emphasis> is the name of the host (machine) where the database server is running.  It has an IP address, and in almost any environment, you can <command>ping</command> the machine name to see if you've got it right.  After it uses the <emphasis>dataserver name</emphasis>  to look up the <emphasis>host name</emphasis>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will do the same thing <command>ping</command> does to get the IP address of the machine to connect to. 
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Finally, the <emphasis>port number</emphasis> is frequently overlooked.  From the network's point of view, knowing the IP address without the port number is a little like knowing the address of an apartment building without knowing the apartment number.  In both cases, it will be hard to find what you came for.  Make sure you <emphasis>know</emphasis> the port number, and that it's correctly entered in the <filename>interfaces</filename> file.  
					</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</sidebar></tip>
			</sect1>

			<sect1 id="interfacesformat">
			<title>What it looks like</title>
			<para>
The format of the  <filename>interfaces</filename> file is borrowed directly from that used by Sybase on Unix platforms (<productname>Windows</productname> has a different format).  Additionally, we have overloaded one of the fields to add the ability to set the protocol version.  An example <filename>interfaces</filename> file looks like this.

The entry starts with the servername beginning in the first column (no

For better or worse, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> brings the otherwise innocent programmer into contact with the arcane business of how data are stored and transported.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> is a data communications library that of course connects to databases, which are charged with storing information in a way that is neutral to all architectures and languages.  On the surface, that might not seem very complex, even worth discussing.  Under the surface, things are not so simple.  
			</para>
		<section id="ascii"><title><acronym>ASCII</>: What everyone knows</title>
			<para>
The world we are all familiar with, programmingwise, is <acronym>ASCII</>.  Our email (mostly), our <quote>text</quote> files, our web pages (mostly), all use <acronym>ASCII</> to represent English (or English-like) text. Perhaps because <ulink url="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html"><acronym>ASCII</></ulink> <footnote><para>czyborra.com is offline at the time of this writing (December 2003).  It contained good information, so it's still included here, in case it comes back to life.  </para></footnote>  was standardized back in 1972 by the ISO, it seems like the <quote>natural</quote> way to store information.  But let's look under the hood a little bit, and examine our assumptions.  
			</para>
			<para>
Our so-called <quote>text</quote> files are nothing special, nothing but a little agreement we enter into with our operating system.  The only reason we can <quote>read</quote> them with <command>cat</command> or <command>vi</command> is that the operating system and its tools are in on the agreement.  A file is only a stream of bytes, after all, no more <quote>text</quote> than an executable.  The only thing distinguishing a <quote>text</quote> file from any other, is our understanding to treat it like one.  We agree that the number 65 will represent the letter <literal>A</literal>, 66, <literal>B</literal>, and so on, 127 values in all.  See <command>man ascii</command> for further details.  
			</para>
			<para>
The important thing to understand is that the designation of 65 for <literal>A</literal> and so on is a choice.  It's an <emphasis>encoding standard</emphasis>, made necessary by the old simple fact that computers store numbers, not letters.  <acronym>ASCII</> is so ubiquitous these days that it's hard sometimes to remember there was a time when it was but one of a set of competing encoding standards.  Others you probably have heard of include <acronym>EBCDIC</> and the Baudot systems, but they are by no means the only historical alternatives, nor the only modern ones.  
			</para>
		<section id="ASCIICompact"><title>The <acronym>ASCII</> Compact</title>
			<para>
UNIX&reg; and unix-like systems bought into <acronym>ASCII</> big time.  Program code, filenames, string constants (and variables), configuration files, everything but everything is encoded in <acronym>ASCII</>.  Practically every utility, command, and library assumes the <quote>text</> data will be <acronym>ASCII</>. At the dawn of the 21<superscript>st</> century, there is widespread recognition that <acronym>ASCII</> will no longer suffice, but the art of upgrading all the computers and computer programmers is, well, an unfinished work.  
			</para>
		</section>
		</section>
		<section id="ISO8859"><title>ISO 8859: What everyone would like to forget</title>
			<para>
<acronym>ASCII</> won, it would seem, but the race goes not to the swift.  <acronym>ASCII</> has many limitations, the most egregious of which is, it's not much good for anything besides English.  It encodes all the letters and punctuation (almost) of the English alphabet, but is useless for German, Russian, and Greek, to say nothing of Chinese.  
			</para>
			<para>
<acronym>ASCII</> assigns one byte to every character, but deals with only 7 of the 8 available bits, the range 0-127 (with the <quote>high bit</quote> always zero).  Demand for computers that could display and print languages besides English &mdash; even English with em dashes and cent (&cent;) signs &mdash; arrived soon enough, with the Marketing Department way out in front of the propeller heads.  The predictable result was an array of <quote>8-bit <acronym>ASCII</></quote> encoding standards for a wide variety of alphabets.  Eventually, they were standardized (or at least enumerated and documented) by the ISO.  These are what our friendly database vendors are referring to when they talk about <emphasis>character sets</emphasis>.  More information on this subject can be found at <ulink url="http://www.webreference.com/dlab/books/html/39-1.html">webreference.com</ulink>.  
	
			</para>
			<para>
The upshot is, there is no uniform standard, no agreement on the meaning of a byte, particularly if that byte's value is greater than 127.  Let's say your client machine sends <literal>HELLO</literal> and your database stores it as  <literal>72 69 76 76 79</literal>.  When another client retrieves that value, it will convert it into human-readable form by applying an encoding standard.  If everything's tightly wrapped, it will use the very same encoding that your database used (and the same one you had in mind when you sent it), and that client will also see <literal>HELLO</literal>.  If things are not so tightly wrapped but that client is fortunate enough to be using a similar standard to what you were using, say, ISO 8859-1, he'll still see <literal>HELLO</literal>.  Most languages based on the Roman alphabet can be represented by ISO 8859-1, and are thus interchangeable.  Beyond that, things get quickly messy.  Greek clients, for one, are not so lucky: there are three ISO 8859 standards for Greek, all mutually incompatible.  

For more information, see <ulink url="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html">ISO 8859 Alphabet Soup</ulink>.  Roman Czyborra's site is very informative; take your time there if you don't want your head to spin.  
			</para>
			<para>
Database servers need to know what encoding standard to employ, too.  It's not obvious at first, but notions like <quote>uppercase</quote> and <quote>lowercase</quote>, trailing blanks, and collation rules all depend on what letter is meant by what number.  (Collation even depends on what culture is interpreting the letters.)  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="Unicode"><title>Unicode: East meets West</title>
			<para>
<acronym>ASCII</> and its 8-bit cousins are on the way out, and with them the assumption that a character can be represented by a single byte.  The new kid on the block is <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</ulink>, similar to but not precisely the same as ISO 10646.  Unicode (despite its name) is a set of standards.  The most widely implemented is the 16-bit form, called UCS-2.  As you might guess, UCS-2 uses two bytes per character, allowing it to encode most characters of most languages.  Because <quote>most</quote> is far from <emphasis>all</emphasis>, there are nascent 32-bit forms, too, but they are neither complete nor in common use.  
			</para>
			<para>
In the same sense that 7-bit <acronym>ASCII</> was extended to 8 bits, Unicode extends the most prevalent <quote>8-bit <acronym>ASCII</></quote>,  <acronym>ISO 8859-1</>, to 16 and 32 bits.  The first 256 values remain in Unicode as in <acronym>ISO 8859-1</>: 65 is still <literal>A</literal>, except instead of being 8 bits (0x40), it's 16 bits (0x0040).  Unlike the 8-bit extensions, Unicode has a unique 1:1 map of numbers to characters, so no language context or <quote>character set</quote> name is needed to decode a Unicode string.  
			</para>
			<para>
UCS-2 is the system employed by Microsoft NT-based systems.  Microsoft database servers store UCS-2 strings in <type>nchar</type> and <type>nvarchar</type> datatypes.  Microsoft also designed version 7.0 (and up) of the <acronym>TDS</> protocol around UCS-2: all metadata (table names and such) are encoded according to UCS-2 on the wire.  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="Unicodegoodbad"><title>Unicode's Pluses and Minuses</title>
			<para>
You will read from time to time that Unicode is not perfect.  Surprise, surprise: it's true.  From a linguistic point of view, Unicode is incomplete; in particular, UCS-2 is demonstrably too small (!) to hold all the forms of Chinese ideographs used over the centuries.  (It is, however, quite useful and widely employed in representing modern Chinese.)  Of more common concern to programmers are Unicode's technical problems, or rather, Unix's technical shortcomings <foreignphrase>vis-a-vis</foreignphrase> any encoding more complex than <acronym>ISO 8859-x</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
The basic problem, from a programmer's perspective, is the ancient agreement Unix entered into 30 years ago, the <quote><acronym>ASCII</> Compact,</quote> alluded to earlier.  Assumptions about <acronym>ASCII</> are littered throughout Unix-like systems, beginning with C's convention of representing strings as arrays of characters ending in a zero.  Returning to our HELLO example earlier, C will store <literal>HELLO</literal> as  <literal>72 69 76 76 79 0</literal>, in very nice <acronym>ASCII</>.  Many many parts of the operating system and its associated tools and applications will recognize that as a 5-letter word because it's terminated by a null (zero).  In UCS-2 Unicode, though, that same <literal>HELLO</literal> uses 2 bytes for every character and becomes <literal>72 0 69 0 76 0 76 0 79 0 0 0</literal>.  Practically the whole OS will think that's a 1-letter word, <quote>H</quote>.  Not a good thing.  
			</para>
			<para>
Even if every OS were magically rid of all <acronym>ASCII</> assumptions and C strings, there would still be the problem of Endianism.  <ulink url="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci211659,00.html">Technical</ulink> <ulink url="http://www.noveltheory.com/TechPapers/endian.asp">explanations</ulink> on the subject are not hard to find.  The long and short of it is, given a 16-bit integer (2 bytes), different hardware architectures will store the value differently.  Asked to store our friend <quote>A</quote>, (0x41), for instance, a Sparc processor will put the least significant byte at the higher address (00 41) whereas an Intel processor will put it in the lower address (41 00).  Put aside the questions of left, right, and wrong; architectures are a fact of life.  Endianism shows up wherever integers are stored and retrieved in heterogeneous environments.  
			</para>
			<para>
The Unicode folks knew about Endianism, of course, and had to address it.  A Unicode bytestream is supposed to begin with a byte-order mark.  Needless to say, perhaps, many don't.  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="UnicodeUtf"><title>Unicode Transformation Format: UTF-8</title>
			<para>
The presence of nulls embedded in character data and of byte order issues make straight Unicode i.e., UCS-2 or UCS-4 hard to work with in a heterogeneous environment.  Too many opportunities arise for the data to be truncated or misinterpreted, and too many systems would fail even to transmit such data.  In short, when 16-bit data are thrust into a multi-architecture 8-bit world, it frequently bodes ill for the data.  
			</para>
			<para>
To answer that problem, to make Unicode transmissible and unambiguous to most machines, several <quote>transformation formats</quote> were adopted.  Their goals were generally similar: to create a generally recognized format that would unambiguously and safely convey Unicode information between machines and across the Internet.  To do that, they sought to remove nulls and endianism from the data stream.  The most popular one &mdash; practically the only one used &mdash; is known as UTF-8.  
			</para>
			<para>
UTF-8 found wide acceptance for many reasons.  UTF-8 represents any Unicode character as a combination of 1-4 bytes.  The number of bytes required depends on the integer value of the Unicode character, and only one byte is used to represent the old <acronym>ASCII</> range (0-127).  UTF-8 does not use zero to represent any part of any character (except for the <acronym>ASCII</> NUL).  In consequence, UTF-8 is efficient with respect to space, has no endianism issues, and embeds no nulls.  UTF-8 strings can be treated as plain old <acronym>ASCII</> strings.  These properties make UTF-8 data relatively easy for systems accustomed to processing <acronym>ASCII</> data.  
			</para>
			<para>
Here's a small example showing the difference between UCS-2 and UTF-8.  
			<example id="e.g.HELLO">
<title><quote>HELLO</quote> in UCS-2 and UTF-8</title>

It is the similarity of the last two outputs that makes UTF-8 so attractive.  It behaves like <acronym>ASCII</> when <acronym>ASCII</>'s all that's needed.  But it lacks <acronym>ASCII</>'s limitations.  			</para>
			<para>
While UTF-8 solves many technical problems, it doesn't magically transform every <acronym>ASCII</>-assuming system into a Unicode system.  For example, to display Unicode data correctly &mdash; even Unicode data in UTF-8 format &mdash; the system still needs a suitable font.  And it must distinguish the buffer size (and byte count) from the character count.

			<para>
Microsoft servers using TDS 7.0 and above (anything since SQL Server 6.5) transmit their data in UCS-2 format (16-bit integers).  Because most applications linked to <productname>FreeTDS</productname> are not prepared to deal with UCS-2 data, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> can convert the data to something more acceptable, including <acronym>ASCII</>.  To do so, it employs an  <productname>iconv</productname>  library.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> determines the server's encoding from the TDS protocol and information reported by the server (generally per connection, but in the case of TDS 8.0, per result set column).  It discovers the client's encoding in <filename>freetds.conf</filename>.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will happily convert and convey your data in any <emphasis>single-byte</emphasis> format that <productname>iconv</productname> can provide.  In practice, this normally means some form of ISO 8859-x or UTF-8.  
			</para>
			<para>
At some future time, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> aims to support Unicode and other multi-byte character sets.  It does not do so at the current time.  
			</para>
			<para>
Sybase servers, by the way, adhere to a <quote>server makes right</quote> policy: they transmit their data in whatever character set the client requested at login time.  The list of available character sets is fairly short, but includes UTF-8.  While  <productname>FreeTDS</> <emphasis>could</> convert Sybase data streams as easily as it does Microsoft data streams, to our knowledge no one is doing so.  The Sybase server can perform the conversion itself, making <productname>FreeTDS</>'s capability in this regard largely redundant and irrelevant.

  <sect1 id="gfdl-0">
    <title>PREAMBLE</title>

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-1">
    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-2">
    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-4">
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the

      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given

      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original

      <listitem><para>In any section entitled

      <listitem><para>Preserve all the

      any Invariant Section.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    
    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    
    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    
    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-11">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote id="sample-copyright"><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.

      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
