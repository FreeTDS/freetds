			<para>
This User Guide is the product of (lots of) happy collaborative effort.  Although Brian's name and mine are at the top of it, behind it are many others, who contributed thoughtful suggestions, bamboozled questions, stellar prose, and terse instructions.  I don't mention this for the usual reasons (the enumeration of which I leave to you) but rather to emphasize that the purpose of our effort is to help you and those who come after you to have the easiest and most enjoyable time with <productname>FreeTDS</productname>.

It is surprisingly hard, after a while, to remember how it can be for someone newly approaching a project to use it.  What seems as obvious as a fog horn to an old hand may be much more like the fog itself to the newcomer.  That can make installing and setting up new software a puzzling or frustrating experience.  You may have heard, <quote>It's easy if you know how.</quote>  Indeed it is, and that's our purpose here: to make it easy, by letting you know how.

		<title>What is <productname>FreeTDS</productname>?</title>

		<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> is an open source (or free software if you prefer) programming library, a re-implementation of the Tabular Data Stream protocol.  It can be used in place of Sybase's <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> or <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> libraries.  It also includes an <systemitem class="library">ODBC library</systemitem>.  It allows many open source applications such as <productname>Perl</productname> and <productname>PHP</productname> (or your own C or C++ program) to connect to Sybase or Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname>.   
		</para>
		<sect1 id="tdsprotocol">
			<title>Background: The <acronym>TDS</> Protocol
				and related <acronym>API</>s
			</title>
			<para>
<acronym>TDS</> is a <firstterm>protocol</firstterm>, a set of rules describing how to transmit data between two computers.  Like any protocol, it defines the types of messages that can be sent, and the order in which they may be sent.  Protocols describe the <quote>bits on the wire</quote>, how data flow.  
			</para>
			<para>
In reading this manual, it may be helpful to keep in mind that a protocol is not an <acronym>API</>, although the two are related.  The server recognizes and speaks a protocol; anything that can send it the correct combination of bytes in the right order can communicate with it.  But programmers aren't generally in the business of sending bytes; that's the job of a library.  Over the years, there have been a few libraries -- each with its own <acronym>API</> -- that do the work of moving SQL through a <acronym>TDS</> pipe.  <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, and  <acronym>JDBC</> have very different <acronym>API</>s, but they're all one to the server, because on the wire they speak <acronym>TDS</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
The <acronym>TDS</> protocol was designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase <productname>SQL Server</productname> relational database engine in 1984.  The problem Sybase faced then still exists: There was no commonly accepted application-level protocol to transfer data between a database server and its client.  To encourage the use of their product, Sybase came up with a flexible pair of products called <productname>netlib</productname> and <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>.
  			</para>
			<para>
<productname>netlib</productname>'s job was to ferry data between the two computers.  To do that, it had to deal with the underlying network protocol.  Remember, in those days <acronym>TCP/IP</> was not the ubiquitous thing it is today.  Besides <acronym>TCP/IP</>, <productname>netlib</productname> ran on <acronym>DECnet</>, <acronym>IPX/SPX</>, <acronym>NetBEUI</> and the like.   
			</para>
			<para>
<systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> provided an <acronym>API</> to the client program, and communicated with the server via <productname>netlib</productname>.  What <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> sent to the server took the form of a stream of bytes, a structured stream of bytes meant for tables of data, a Tabular Data Stream.  
			</para>
			<para>
In 1990 Sybase entered into a technology sharing agreement with Microsoft which resulted in Microsoft marketing its own <productname>SQL Server</productname>. Microsoft kept the <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</> and added <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem>.  (Microsoft has since added other <acronym>API</>s, too.)

At about the same time, Sybase introduced a more powerful <quote>successor</quote> to <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, called <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, and called the pair <productname>OpenClient</productname>.  
			</para>
			<para>

<systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, and <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> are <acronym>API</>s that -- however different their programming style may be -- all use <productname>netlib</productname> to communicate to the server.  The language they use is <acronym>TDS</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
The <acronym>TDS</> protocol comes in several flavors, most of which have never
been openly documented.  If anything, it's probably considered to be something like a trade secret, or at least proprietary technology.  The exception is TDS 5.0, used exclusively by Sybase, for which documentation is available <ulink url="http://crm.sybase.com/sybase/www/ESD/tds_spec_download.jsp">from Sybase</ulink>.
			</para>
			<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> was and is developed by observation and experimentation, which is to say, by trial and error.

		<sect1 id="history">
			<title>History of <acronym>TDS</> Versions</title>
			
			<para>
At first, there was One Version of <acronym>TDS</> common to both vendors, but in keeping with the broad history of private ventures, they soon diverged. Each vendor has subsequently brought out different versions, and neither supports the other's flavor. That is to say, each vendor's client libraries use the latest version of <acronym>TDS</> offered by that vendor.  You can't reliably use Microsoft's libraries to connect to Sybase, or Sybase's libraries to connect to Microsoft.  In some cases you'll get a connection, but pretty soon you'll bump into some incompatibility.

			<para>
In early 1997, the only option for connecting to a Sybase dataserver from Linux or other free systems was an aging Sybase-released version of <productname>OpenClient</productname>.  Unfortunately it had a few problems.  The original release was a.out based, although Greg Thain did a great service in converting the library to ELF.  Secondly, it included only the newer <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>.  The older <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</> was missing.
			</para>
			<para>
Brian Bruns, a Sybase DBA and originator of the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> project, had some <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> programs he wanted to run under Linux, and thus began the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> project. The original work focused on <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> and version 5.0 of the protocol, but quickly expanded to include a <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> compatible layer and <acronym>TDS</> version 4.2.  Later support for <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> and <acronym>TDS 7.0 and 8.0</> was added. Craig Spannring wrote a Java  <acronym>JDBC</> driver which became <productname>FreeTDS/JDBC</productname>.

			<listitem><para>
The <productname>FreeTDS</productname> C libraries support three separate <acronym>API</>s: <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, and <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem>.  Underlying these three is libtds which handles the low-level details of the <acronym>TDS</> protocol, such as sending, receiving, and datatype conversion.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
The <productname>FreeTDS/JDBC</productname>, developed by Craig Spannring, is a free, native 100% Java implementation of a Type 4  <acronym>JDBC</> driver.  Currently it has only been tested mostly on <productname>SQL Server 6.5</productname> and 7.0.  The driver is not complete, but Methods that aren't implemented will throw a SQLException with the message <quote>Not implemented</quote>.  This project has recently gotten a second wind as the <productname>jTDS</productname> project on <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtds/">SourceForge</ulink>
.

			<title>Status</title>
			<para>
As of version 0.60, the <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> and <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>s are fairly stable.  They have been successfully  substituted for Sybase's own libraries in a variety of venues, including <productname>Perl</productname> and <productname>PHP</productname>.  That is not to say that these drivers are complete; they're not.  But they faithfully implement an important subset of their <acronym>API</>s, enough to be useful.  
			</para>
			<para>
In addition to the core <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname>  includes a full implementation of <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>'s <acronym>bcp</> functions, as well as <application>freebcp</application>, a replacement for Sybase's <application>bcp</application> utility.  
			</para>
			<para>
The <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> driver is slightly weaker but may be usable depending on your application's needs.  It is under active development.  Any problems found in the currently implemented <acronym>API</> subset are cheerfully  addressed.  
The <productname>FreeTDS</productname> 0.60 ODBC driver was a vast improvement over earlier versions, and with 0.61 it began to comply with the ODBC 3.0 specification.
			</para>
			<para>
Basic API coverage information is available at <ulink url="http://www.freetds.org/api_status.txt">www.freetds.org</ulink> (that file is also shipped with the source distribution).  Detailed information about the extent of the <acronym>API</> coverage is being prepared.

		</sect2>
		<sect2>
			<title>Languages besides C and Java</title>
			<para>
You may be wondering how these libraries fit with Perl, PHP, TCL, Python, or other popular scripting languages.  Most of these languages have bindings to Sybase that use either the <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> or <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>s, for which <productname>FreeTDS</productname> is intended as a drop-in replacement.  For instance, Michael Peppler's <systemitem class="library">DBD::Sybase</systemitem> works very well using <productname>FreeTDS</productname> to access Sybase or Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname>s.  <productname>PHP</productname> has options for <filename>sybase</filename> (<systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>) and <filename>sybase-ct</filename> (<systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>) <acronym>API</>s.
			</para>
			<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> is a source code library, though, not a binary one.  It has to be linked to a program.  For it to be useful to you in any way, you have to be prepared to break out your build tools.

			<para>
After <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has been built and installed, it still doesn't know where your servers are or what particular version of Sybase or Microsoft software each one is using.  The purpose of this section is to explain how to describe your dataservers to <productname>FreeTDS</productname>.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has not one but two ways to do this, in <filename>freetds.conf</filename> and <filename>interfaces</filename>, described below.  It also can use environment variables to override settings in those configuration files.  One of the more important (and arcane) settings is the <acronym>TDS</> protocol version, described next.

   			<title>Choosing a <acronym>TDS</> protocol version</title>
			<para>
The <acronym>TDS</> protocol version is probably something you'd rather not know even existed, much less something you'd have to choose.  But there's not that much to it, really.  Unless you run into an incompatibility, you're best off running with the highest protocol version supported by your server.  That's what the vendors' own products do, which is why when you read the Sybase or Microsoft documentation you find no mention of <acronym>TDS</> versions.

Why downgrade your protocol?  If you encounter a bug, reverting to 4.2 can help isolate it.  If you're using low-bandwidth connections, 4.2 is faster than 7.0, because 7.0 transfers all character data in UCS-2 (unicode, 2 bytes/character).

			<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> uses a configuration file called
<emphasis><filename>freetds.conf</filename></emphasis>  (the name of
the file can be controlled by an environment variable).  Its format
is similar to Samba's modified
<quote><filename>win.ini</filename></quote> format.  Its foremost job
is to relate  <emphasis>dataserver</emphasis> names, as known to your
programs, to  <emphasis>machine</emphasis> names, as known your
network.  That is, while your machines have names known to the
network, the dataservers on your machines have names known only to
your  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> client programs.  The
configuration file can then further describe that dataserver in
greater detail, as need be.  
			</para>
			<para>
<note><para>	<productname>FreeTDS</productname> also supports an older configuration file format, known as the <filename>interfaces</filename> file.  Use <filename>freetds.conf</filename> unless <filename>interfaces</filename> is needed for your situation.  It is easier to read, and it is where all the new options are being added.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> looks for <filename>freetds.conf</filename> first, falling back on <filename>interfaces</filename> only if <filename>freetds.conf</filename> is not found.

You can use environment variables to 
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Advertise the location of the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> libraries to programs that want them.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Override some of the settings in <productname>FreeTDS</productname>'s configuration file.  </para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Control how logging is done.  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

This section covers the first two items.  For information about environment variables that control logging, see <link linkend="logging">Logging</link>
			</para>
			
			<sect3><title><envar>SYBASE</envar></title>

			<para>
The environment variable <envar>SYBASE</envar> points to the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> run-time directory.  That convention originated with SYBASE, and many programs still rely on the <envar>SYBASE</envar> to discover the location of the <quote>SYBASE</quote> libraries.  
			</para>

			<para>
The primary use of <envar>SYBASE</envar> is to advertise the location of the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> libraries.  A secondary use is to point to the location of the <filename>interfaces</filename> file (if used, see the <link linkend="interfacesfile">Appendix</link>).   
			</para>
			</sect3>
			
			<sect3><title><envar>TDSVER</envar></title>
			<para>
The environment variable <envar>TDSVER</envar> governs the version of the <acronym>TDS</> protocol used to connect to your server.  For a given server, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> inspects four sources in the following order to determine which <acronym>TDS</> protocol version to use.
			</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem><para>The value specified in the <envar>TDSVER</envar> environment variable
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>A <filename>freetds.conf</filename> file entry (see below)
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>The <filename>interfaces</filename> file entry (see below)
					</para></listitem>

        		</sect3>
			
        		 <sect3><title><envar>FREETDSCONF</envar></title>
        		 <para>
The <envar>FREETDSCONF</envar> environment variable may be
used to specify the name and location of the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> file.
			</para>
		        </sect3>
        		 <sect3><title><envar>TDSPORT</envar></title>
        		 <para>
The <envar>TDSPORT</envar> environment variable specifies a TCP port number to be
used to connect to the dataserver with.  It overrides the version default port (1433 for TDS 4.2/7.0/8.0, 4000 for TDS 5.0) as well as any port specified in the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> file.

        		 <sect3><title><envar>TDSQUERY</envar> and <envar>DSQUERY</envar></title>
        		 <para>
The <envar>TDSQUERY</envar> environment variable provides a server name to connect to if none is specified by the application.  DSQUERY is the historical Sybase name for this variable.
			</para>
		        </sect3>
        		 <sect3><title><envar>TDSHOST</envar></title>
        		 <para>
The <envar>TDSHOST</envar> environment variable overrides the host specified in the <filename>freetds.conf</>.

Of course, each shell is a little different.  In the Bourne shell and variants such as <application>ksh</application> and <application>bash</application>, to set
<envar>Sybase</envar> and <envar>TDSVER</envar> do:

<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export SYBASE=/usr/local/freetds</userinput>  # (or your favorite directory)
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export TDSVER=4.2</userinput>
</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
In <application>csh</application>:

<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>setenv SYBASE /usr/local/freetds</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>setenv TDSVER 4.2</userinput>
</screen>
			</para>
			</sect2>
			<sect2>
				<title>Checking your work</title>

When you're done, you should see something very like this:

			<title>Big Endian Clients with Buggy <productname>SQL Server</productname>s</title>
			<para>
Several version of Microsoft SQL server have a bug that affects big endian clients.  This includes 7.0 GA and 7.0 SP1.  Furthermore, <acronym>TDS</> Protocol version 7.0 is natively little endian. <productname>SQL Server 2000</productname> is also reported not to work from big endian clients without little endian emulation turned on.
			</para>
<Note><para>If you are unfamiliar with the terms <emphasis>big endian</emphasis> and <emphasis>little endian</emphasis>, they are terms that come originally from Gullivers Travels.  What they refer to in computer science is the the order in which bytes are stored by a processor.  Big endian machines such as Sparc and PowerPC store the most significant byte in the first memory location of a multi-byte integer.  Little endian machines such as Intel and Alpha do it the other way around.  So the 16-bit number 258 would be 0x0102 on big endian and 0x0201 on little endian machines.</para></Note>

<para>
In this example we want to force connections to a server named <literal>mssql</literal> to emulate a little endian client.  We are using protocol version 4.2 here, version 7.0 and 8.0 will automatically emulate little endian mode regardless of the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> setting.
</para>
<example>
<title>Emulate Little Endian <filename>freetds.conf</filename> setting</title>
<programlisting>
[mssql]
	host = ntbox.mydomain.com
	port = 1433
	tds version = 4.2
	emulate little endian = yes

			<title><acronym>TDS</> 7.0 for Nonwestern Languages</title>
			<para>
<acronym>TDS</> 7.0 uses 2-byte Unicode (<acronym>UCS-2</>) to transfer all textual data between servers and clients.  By default, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> converts this data to 8-bit <acronym>ASCII</> representation by stripping the high order byte.  This is generally sufficient for western languages such as English, but produces garbage for other languages.
			</para>
			<para>
Since, most Unix tools and languages do not support <acronym>UCS-2</>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> allows conversion by the client to other character sets using the <ulink url="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/iconv.html">iconv</ulink> standard.  Background information on Unicode and how it affects <productname>FreeTDS</productname> can be found in the <link linkend="Unicode">appendix</link>.

To list all supported iconv character sets under Linux, use the <application>iconv</application> command.
			</para>

			<para>
For other systems, consult your documentation (most likely <command>man iconv</command> will give you some hints).

			<para>
In this example a server named <literal>mssql</literal> will return data encoded in the GREEK character set.

<example>
<title>Configuring for GREEK <filename>freetds.conf</filename> setting</title>
<programlisting>
[mssql]
	host = ntbox.mydomain.com
	port = 1433
	tds version = 7.0
	client charset = GREEK
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>
If <application>iconv</application> runs into a character it can not convert, it will replace that character with a '?' character.  Always ensure that the data contained in the database is representable in the chosen character set.
</para>
<para>
If you have a mix of character data that can not be contained in a single byte character set, you may wish to use <acronym>UTF-8</>.  <acronym>UTF-8</> is a variable length unicode encoding that is compatible with <acronym>ASCII</> in the range 0 to 127.  With <acronym>UTF-8</>, you are guaranteed to never have an unconvertible character.
</para>
<Important><para><productname>FreeTDS</productname> is not fully compatible with multi-byte character sets such as <acronym>UTF-8</> and <acronym>UCS-2</>.  Extreme care should be taken with testing applications using these encodings. Specifically, many applications fail to expect a number of characters returning that will exceed the column size.  On the other hand, support of <acronym>UTF-8</> and <acronym>UCS-2</> is a high priority for the developers.  Patches and bug reports in this area are especially welcome.  
</para></Important>
			<para>
In the following example, a server named <literal>mssql</literal> will return data encoded in the <acronym>UTF-8</> character set.

	client charset = UTF-8
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>
It is also worth clarifying that <acronym>TDS 7.0</> and above do not accept any specified character set during login, as 4.2 does.  <acronym>TDS 7.0</> transmits all data as <acronym>UCS-2</>.  Specifying a character set with the <literal>charset</literal> option in  <filename>freetds.conf</filename>, or by calling <function>DBSETLCHARSET</function> and its equivalents will be ignored under <acronym>TDS 7.0</>.

			<title>Domain Logins</title>
			<para>
As mentioned in the installation chapter, <productname>SQL Server</productname> includes the ability to use domain logins instead of standard server logins.  The advantage of doing this is that the passwords are encrypted on the wire using a challenge-response protocol (for more information search the net for NTLMSSP authentication).
			</para>
			<para>
<example>
<title>Turning on domain login support in <filename>freetds.conf</filename></title>

	tds version = 7.0
	try domain login = yes
	try server login = no
</programlisting>
</example>
			</para>
<Note><para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> began supporting domain logins in version 0.60.  It appears that server- and domain-logins are mutually exclusive.  That is, although we would like it to be the case that you could set both <literal>try domain login</> and <literal>try server login</> to <literal>yes</>, we're not sure you can.  Not yet, anyway.  To work around this, you can simply use two sections for the server (one in each mode) in  <filename>freetds.conf</filename>. If you specify a username with the <literal>DOMAIN\user</> syntax, 
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> automatically uses a domain login for TDS versions 7.0 and 8.0.
</para></Note>

			<title>Appending Dump Files</title>
			<para>
When running <productname>FreeTDS</productname> with applications such as <productname>Apache</productname>/PHP it is often difficult to get a usable log file.  Since each of the many httpd children opens the file at the beginning of its connection and closes it on connection close, they tend to stomp all over each other.  In append mode, the log file is opened for append each time it is written to and then immediately closed.  If you are experiencing problems when running under <productname>Apache</productname> (or similar application) use append mode to generate useful logs.
			</para>
<example>
<title>Turning on Dump File Append mode in  <filename>freetds.conf</filename></title>
<programlisting>
[mssql]
	host = ntbox.mydomain.com
	port = 1433
	tds version = 7.0
	dump file = /tmp/freetds.log
	dump file append = yes
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>
In this example, the <filename>/tmp/freetds.log</filename> file will contain log entries for all processes using the Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname> server, identified by pid.
</para>
<Important><para>
Because there will be one log file being opened and closed more or less continuously, there is going to be a negative impact on performance. Also, be advised that the log file will grow quite large.
</para></Important>
<para>
As an alternative to <productname>FreeTDS</productname> logging, you might also consider using <application>tcpdump</application> or <application>ethereal</application> to log network packets.  While not as useful as a <acronym>TDS</> log, it can also help to identify problems.
</para>

		<sect1 id="tdspool">
		<title>TDS Connection Pooling</title>
		<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> 0.52 was the first to include a <acronym>TDS</> Connection Pooling server.  It lives in the <filename>src/pool</filename> directory.  
		</para>
		<para>
The <productname>FreeTDS</productname> connection pool is a server process, it acts just like a <productname>SQL Server</productname>.  You can use any program to attach to it that you could use to attach to a real <productname>SQL Server</productname>.  The pool in turn connects to the <productname>SQL Server</productname> and database you specify, and attempts to share these connections.  See the <filename>README</filename> in the pool directory for a more detailed description of its inner workings.
		</para>
		<para>
To configure the pooling server, first make sure <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has a working entry for the real <productname>SQL Server</productname> by connecting to it with <application>SQSH</application> or another program. 
		</para>

		<para>
Now, let's put this into practice.
<example>
<title>pool.conf</title>
<programlisting>
[global]
	min pool conn = 5
	max pool conn = 10
	max member age = 120

[mypool]
	user = webuser
	password = secret
	database = ebiz
	server = fooserv
	max pool conn = 7
	port = 5000
</programlisting>
</example>
First, the <literal>[global]</literal> section defines that we will open 5 connections against the server initially, and will increase up to 10 as demand requires.  These connections will be closed after being idle for 2 minutes (120 seconds), but only until there are 5 remaining open.
		</para>
		<para>
The <literal>[mypool]</literal> section defines a pool named <literal>mypool</literal> that will listen on port 5000.  It will login to a <productname>SQL Server</productname> named <literal>fooserv</literal> using the user <literal>webuser</literal> and the ever so clever password of <literal>secret</literal>.  Once logged in, the connections will use the database <literal>ebiz</literal> instead of webuser's default database.  Also, since this <productname>SQL Server</productname> has a limited number of <acronym>CAL</>s (Client Access Licenses), we are restricting the maximum number of connections to 7, which overrides the <literal>global</literal> setting of 10.
		</para>
		<para>
Now you can run <Command>tdspool</Command> with the name of the pool you are serving.  
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput> tdspool mypool</userinput>
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>
Before your clients connect to the pool, you must edit your <filename>freetds.conf</filename> to include the host/port of the pooling server, and point your clients at it!

The following programs are known to work to some extent with <productname>FreeTDS</productname>, here you will find any special instructions on getting them compiled or running.

		<sect1>
			<title><application>SQSH</application></title>
			<para>
<application>SQSH</application> is a command line based query tool written by Scott Gray to replace the program <application>isql</application> that ships with <productname>Sybase ASE</productname>.  It makes a great diagnostic tool for <productname>FreeTDS</productname> as well.  If you are having trouble, install <application>SQSH</application> (it's easy) and try getting that to work before more complicated arrangements.<tip><sidebar><para>That advice is so good, it bears repeating.  If you are having trouble, grab <application>SQSH</application> and get that to work. Not only will it help isolate the problem, it will give you a very capable tool.  </para></sidebar></tip>
			</para>
			<para>
<application>SQSH</application> 2.1 includes direct support for <productname>FreeTDS</productname>, so these instructions may not be necessary, but are still included just in case.
			</para>
			<para>
After running <Command>configure</Command> in <application>SQSH</application>'s directory (make sure you set the Sybase environment variable first), look for the Sybase_LIBS definition in the Makefile.  Change the line to match this example.
<example>
<title>The <application>SQSH</application> Makefile</title>
<programlisting>
#
#  The following set of CT-LIB libraries were determined automatically
#  by 'configure'.  For most systems configure looks up the required
#  libraries by looking at the name of the OS (although this doesn't
#  mean it got them right), however if the line below ends with the
#  word "Guess", then 'configure' didn't have an entry for your operating
#  system and it took a best guess to figure out which libraries you
#  need. In either case, there may be problems, so look this line over
#  and if it doesn't work, compare it to the libraries located in
#  $SYBASE/samples/ct-library.
#
#  The listings below show suggested libraries for Operating Systems
#  that frequently fail to be recognized by 'configure':
#
#  SCO:   -lblk -lct -lcs -lcomn -ltcl -ltli -lnsl_s -lintl -m -lsocket
#  Dynix: -lblk -lct -lcs -lcomn -ltcl -ltli -lnsl -lintl -lm -lseq
#
SYBASE_LIBS   = -lct -ldl -lm
</programlisting>
</example>
At this point you can also enable <application>readline</application> support if you didn't specify it in the <application>configure</application> arguments.

			<title>Perl</title>
			<para>
There are a few ways to use <productname>Perl</productname> to connect to a <productname>SQL Server</productname> using <productname>FreeTDS</productname>.
The first is using <systemitem class="library">DBD::Sybase</systemitem> from Michael Peppler.  Despite the name it works for either the range of Sybase servers or Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname>.  <systemitem class="library">DBD::Sybase</systemitem> uses the <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</> and works well.  
			</para>
			<para>
There is a <systemitem class="library">DBD::FreeTDS</systemitem> written by Craig Spannring which is a native implementation in <productname>Perl</productname>, however it has not seen development in quite some time.
			</para>
			<para>
A third option is to use <systemitem class="library">DBD::ODBC</systemitem> with the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> driver.  Brian has gotten this to work fairly well but it is still new, so YMMV.
			</para>
			<para>
Lastly, you can use <systemitem class="library">Sybperl</systemitem>.  Scripts written against <systemitem class="library">Sybperl</systemitem> will not run against other databases like DBI will, however it will be familiar ground for those used to <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> or <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>.

			<title>PHP</title>
			<para>
There are three options for building PHP with support for <productname>FreeTDS</productname> corresponding to the three <acronym>API</>s that <productname>FreeTDS</productname> supports: <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem>, <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>, and <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem>.
<note><para>All these examples build the CGI version.  Consult <ulink url="http://www.php.net/docs.php">PHP's documentation</ulink> for building the Apache module and including other extensions.</para></note>
			</para>
		<sect2 id="phpDblib">
			<title><systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem></title>
			<para>
<systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> is perhaps the most straightforward to build.  Previously, some source
code tweaking was required to build PHP with both <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> and DBM support, but 
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> has handled that automatically since version 0.53.
 			</para>
			<para>
First build <productname>FreeTDS</productname> normally.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/freetds</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>su root</userinput>

<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd php</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-sybase=/usr/local/freetds</userinput>

<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>su root</userinput>
<prompt>Password: </prompt>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput>
</screen>
And that's it!  
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
			<title><systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem></title>
			<para>
Option 2 is to use the <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>.  Again here, we run into minor difficulties at build time.  Applications linking with Sybase's OpenClient have to link in a handful of libraries and these libraries vary slightly from platform to platform.  When creating <productname>FreeTDS</productname> it was decided that there would be only one library: <filename>libct</filename>.  This saves a great deal of library naming conflicts that Sybase ran into (e.g. <filename>libtcl</filename> is used both by Sybase and the language TCL), however some applications like PHP assume that all the Sybase libraries will be present. So, some hand editing of the Makefile is necessary to remove these extra libs.  Build <productname>FreeTDS</productname> just as you would for <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> in 
<link linkend="phpDblib"> with <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem></link>, above. Then configure PHP with <systemitem class="library">ct-lib</systemitem>.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd php</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-sybase-ct=/usr/local/freetds</userinput>
</screen>
Now edit the <filename>Zend/Makefile</filename> looking for the <literal>libZend_la_LDFLAGS</literal> line and remove <literal>-lsybtcl -lintl -lcomn</literal> and <literal>-lcs</literal>, leaving the <literal>-lct</literal>. Then proceed to make and install PHP.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>su root</userinput>
<prompt>Password: </prompt>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput>
</screen>
We hope an upcoming version of PHP will automatically detect the presence of <productname>FreeTDS</productname> and include only the <literal>-lct</literal> library.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
			<title><systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem></title>
			<para>
The third and newest option is to use the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> driver with PHP.  This option is somewhat immature, so buyer beware. First build the <productname>iODBC</productname> driver manager and <productname>FreeTDS</productname> as detailed <link linkend="iodbc">in this guide</link>.  Then build PHP with support for <productname>iODBC</productname>.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd php</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-iodbc=/usr/local</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>su root</userinput>
<prompt>Password: </prompt>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput>

Now everything should run.  There is a sample PHP script in the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> samples directory called <filename>odbctest.php</filename>.

			<title>SybSQL</title>
			<para>
<productname>SybSQL</productname> is a <productname>Qt</productname>-based <acronym>GUI</> interface to <productname>Sybase</productname> databases that uses the <systemitem class="library">db-lib</systemitem> <acronym>API</>.
			</para>
			<para>
<productname>SybSQL</productname> has a fairly basic build process that simply uses a Makefile.  In order for <productname>SybSQL</productname> to find <productname>Qt</productname> and <productname>FreeTDS</productname> you need to define <envar>QTDIR</envar> and <envar>SYBASE</envar> environment variables respectively.  If you have <productname>Qt</productname> installed, chances are you may have <envar>QTDIR</envar> defined already.  To verify type <command>echo $QTDIR</command> at the shell prompt.  This example uses my own installation path of <filename>qt-2.3.1</filename> (from RedHat 7.2), YMMV.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-2.3.1</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export SYBASE=/usr/local</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput>
</screen>
When finished you'll have an executable named <filename>sybsql</filename> that you can run.  
			</para>
			<para>
One caveat to the way in which <productname>SybSQL</productname> and <productname>FreeTDS</productname> interact is that <productname>SybSQL</productname> expects to be running under <productname>OpenClient</productname>, and makes the assumption that a valid <envar>$SYBASE</envar><filename>/interfaces</filename> file exists.  Since <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has deprecated use of the <filename>interfaces</filename> file in favor of the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> config file, a slight work around is required.
			</para>
			<para>
In <productname>FreeTDS</productname>'s <filename>bin</filename> directory, there is a script, <filename>conf2interfaces</filename>, to convert the <filename>freetds.conf</filename> file back into an <filename>interfaces</filename> file.  Running this, you may convert your <filename>freetds.conf</filename> into a old-style <filename>interfaces</filename> file to make <productname>SybSQL</productname> happy.  For instance,
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>mkdir ~/freetds</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>conf2interfaces /usr/local/etc/freetds.conf > ~/freetds/interfaces</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export SYBASE=~/freetds</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>sybsql</userinput>
</screen>
By defining <envar>SYBASE</envar> to the parent directory of the <filename>interfaces</filename> file, you may put it where ever you like; it does not have to be in <filename>/usr/local</filename>.  When using <filename>freetds.conf</filename>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> does not rely on the <envar>SYBASE</envar> variable for finding its own components, so it is safe to point it elsewhere.

Here we specified that the  <acronym>JDBC</> entry from the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> <filename>interfaces</filename> file will show on a listing of DSNs (if this is Greek to you, please consult some <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> documentation) and tell it to use the <filename>libtdsodbc</filename> library to connect with.  
			</para>
			<para>
<productname>iODBC</productname> comes with a sample command line query program called <filename>odbctest</filename> that is located in the <filename>iodbc/samples</filename> directory.  Using this program you can get a listing of DSNs, connect, and issue queries.  It is often useful to compile a program such as this directly against the <productname>FreeTDS</productname> driver instead of using a driver manager.  This makes it simpler to debug if something goes wrong.  To do so, simply compile and install the <systemitem class="library">ODBC</systemitem> driver with <productname>iODBC</productname> as normal, then compile and link the program directly:

<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make odbctest.o</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gcc -g -o odbctest odbctest.o /usr/local/freetds/lib/libtdsodbc.a</userinput>
</screen>
The <literal>-g</literal> is important to keep the symbol tables for debugging purposes.  Now you can run <application>gdb</application> or another debugger and set breakpoints on functions in the library without the driver manager getting in the way.

Supposing everything compiles and installs without trouble, how do you know if <productname>unixODBC</productname> works?  Or, if you know it doesn't, what then?  
			</para>
			<para>
First, make sure you can connect with <application>tsql</application>.  Then try the <application>isql</application> that comes with <productname>unixODBC</productname>.  If <application>tsql</application> works and <application>isql</application> doesn't, you've really isolated the problem to the <productname>unixODBC</productname> setup.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> might have some interoperability problems with  <productname>unixODBC</productname>, but mere connection to the database isn't one of them!

Next, try <command>isql -v <replaceable>dsn</> <replaceable>username</> <replaceable>password</></command>.  Probably that won't tell you much more.  Last suggestion is to turn on logging.  Simple inspection of the log will make clear what server is being connected to (if any) and what account is being used.  Often, that will lead you back to the .ini files.  Better guidance will be provided in this space as the editor becomes better informed.

				<title><type>Text</type> Fields</title>
			<para>
Questions sometimes arise over large <type>varchar</type> types (anything larger than <type>varchar(255)</type>) that became available with Microsoft <productname>SQL Server 7.0</productname>.  When accessing long <type>varchar</type>s with <acronym>TDS</> protocol version 4.2 or 5.0, these fields will be truncated to 255 characters, due to limitations inherent in the protocol definition.  Your best bet in that case is to convert them to <type>text</type> types.  
			</para>
			<para>
In Microsoft <productname>SQL Server</productname> 7.0 and later, <structname>varchar</structname> types can hold up to 8000 bytes (8000 <acronym>ASCII</> characters or 4000 Unicode characters).  To move these large <structname>varchar</structname>s through <acronym>TDS</> 4.2, convert them with either a <command>CONVERT</command> as in, 
<screen>
<userinput>SELECT mycol = convert(mycol, text) FROM mytable</userinput> </screen>
or with the newer SQL92 <command>CAST</command> syntax e.g., 
<screen>
<userinput>SELECT CAST(mycol as TEXT) FROM mytable</userinput></screen>
			</para>
			<para>
A related problem is that some people have reported problems with <type>text</type> field using <acronym>TDS</> version 7.0.  One known workaround is to convert long strings to <type>varchar(8000)</type> in your query text with <command>CAST( <parameter>variable_name</parameter> as <type>varchar</type>(8000) ) as <parameter>variable_name</parameter></command>.  Text datatype handling is fixed in <productname>FreeTDS</productname> 0.60, except for bcp operations.  
			</para>
			<para>
There is also a bug (<quote>Lions and tigers and bugs!  Oh, my!</quote>) in Microsoft's implementation of <type>text</type> fields.  Disregardless [sic] of their documentation, you must explicitly set the value of <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar>, else the text fields will be represented to have a maximum size of 4 gigabytes or so.  The usual manifestation is some sort of spurious <quote>out of memory</quote> error or segment fault.  To avoid this, set <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar> to some reasonable value before querying any <type>TEXT</type> fields.  For example, in <application>isql</application>:
<screen>
<prompt>1></prompt><userinput>set <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar> 10000</userinput>
<prompt>2></prompt><userinput>go</userinput>
</screen>

Another way to handle control the default <envar>TEXTSIZE</envar> is to use the setting in <link linkend="freetdsconfformat"><filename>freetds.conf</filename></link>.

    			<title>Endianism</title>
			<para>
If either your server or your client is a big endian system, pay careful attention to all references to endianism anywhere near <productname>FreeTDS</productname>.  Endian repairs are ongoing, partly because everything is ongoing, and partly because Microsoft has been breaking and re-breaking how their servers respond to big endian clients.  See the section on <link linkend="emulle">Little Endian Emulation</link> for details.

			<sect2>
				<title><type>Datetime</type> and <type>Money</type></title>
			<para>
Big endian clients may experience difficulty with Microsoft servers.  Some versions of <productname>SQL Server</productname> 7 did not handle these types on these machines correctly, according to the protocol.  According to 
<ulink url="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q254/1/23.ASP"> http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q254/1/23.ASP</ulink> on the Microsoft support site, it's fixed as of service pack 3.  Unfortunately, there's no direct way for <productname>FreeTDS</productname> to know whether or not a service pack has been installed, and how/whether to support the buggy version is an outstanding issue.  Your best bet is to apply their patch.

				<listitem><para><firstterm>Mixed Mode</> Combines the above two.

			</ItemizedList>
For normal operation, you need either Standard or Mixed mode.
			</para>
			<para>
<quote>Windows NT Authentication</quote>, often called <quote>integrated security</quote>,
relies on Microsoft's <emphasis>domain login</emphasis>. In it, a user's network security attributes are established at network login time. When connecting to the database server, <productname>SQL
Server</productname> uses the facilities of the host operating system (<productname>Windows NT </productname> or similar) to determine the authenticated network username.
<productname>SQL Server</productname> then permits or denies login access based on that network
username alone, without requiring a separate login name and password.
			</para>
<Note><para>
The <productname>FreeTDS</productname> has recently added support for integrated security mode.  If you have <productname>SQL Server</productname> running in integrated (domain) mode along with a Windows PDC, and wish to try it, see <link linkend="domains">Domain Logins</link> in the <link linkend="configs">Advanced Configurations</link> chapter.
</para></Note>
			<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> supports the traditional database
security model, which Microsoft terms <quote>SQL Server
Authentication</quote> but is frequently known as <quote>standard
security</quote>. Username+Password pairs have to be passed to the
server explicitly.
			</para>
			<para>
Mixed Mode allows users to connect using either authentication
method. Users who connect through a <productname>Windows NT</productname> account can make use
of trusted connections in either Windows NT Authentication Mode or
Mixed Mode. After successful connection to <productname>SQL
Server</productname>, the security mechanism is the same for both
modes.

A couple of important notes about using the logs with <productname>FreeTDS</productname>.  First,
the logs tend to grow large, so trim or archive them often.  Secondly,
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> will record certain network packets to the log, this

equivalent passwords.</emphasis> So, if this is a concern (most likely
is) make sure that the files are not world readable, and avoid posting

    			<title>Isolate the cause</title>
			<para>
Successful problem isolation will yield earliest resolution.  You (believe it or not) have more information about your environment than anyone else does, and have the greatest motivation to solve your problem.  The resources at your disposal will be much more useful if the problem is specific.  (Sorry if this is obvious.  If it is, you might be surprised how often it's not.)
			</para>
			<para>
If you can demonstrate the problem with <application>tsql</> or <application>sqsh</>, you can expect a quick answer to your question, possibly even a fairly quick fix.  (It has happened several times in the last few years that bug reports to small problems were fixed the same day.  On a few occasions, new functions were added in a few days.  Making <productname>FreeTDS</productname> useful and bugless is the goal of the project, after all.)  
			</para>
			<para>
<productname>FreeTDS</productname> being what it is, problems frequently arise amidst complex environments.  It can be hard for both you and the list participants -- who are your allies and best resource -- to determine what's going wrong.  If you can submit a script that they can use to try to reproduce your results, you have a much better chance of happy resolution.  
			</para>
			<para>
On the plus side, the list includes people with a variety of backgrounds, who frequently answer questions that aren't really about <productname>FreeTDS</productname> <foreignphrase>per se</foreignphrase>.  Clear questions have sometimes even led to submitting patches to other projects.

The best possible scenario is, you write a program similar to the ones in the unittests directories. It should be small and demonstrate the problem.  These are usually fixed in a jiffy.

			<para>
Moving down, Perl or PHP code provided it creates all the tables it needs and populates them will generally result in a quick fix.  A stand alone query that will run in <application>SQSH</application> also works well.
			<tip><para>If you provide an SQL query in your question to the list, provide a table definition, too.  Problems are often related to specific datatypes, so a table definition is an absolute must.  You can run <command>sp_help <parameter>table</parameter></command> to generate one.  </para></tip>

Be clear about your setup.  Which row of the <link linkend="configurations">Configurations Section</link> represents yours?  Indicate whether you're using the  <acronym>JDBC</> or C libraries.  Try changing the value of <envar>TDSVER</envar>, to see if it is specifically related to the protocol level.

It is very helpful if you can show an example of the problem using <productname>sqsh</> or <productname>tsql</> (the latter is included in with <productname>FreeTDS</productname>).  Using those programs limits the scope of question to <productname>FreeTDS</productname> itself.

	<Appendix><title>The <filename>interfaces</filename> File</title>
			<Abstract><para>The <filename>interfaces</filename> file is retained for compatibility with Sybase environments.  It is recommended that new users use the <link linkend="freetdsconf">freetds.conf</link> format instead.</para></Abstract>
		<sect1 id="interfacesfile">
			<title>Where it came from</title>
			<para>
Under Sybase OpenClient there is a file called <filename>interfaces</filename> that defines servers available to the software.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> inherited this file structure with minor alterations.  The <filename>interfaces</filename> remains supported for backward compatibility, and for those running in a mixed <productname>FreeTDS</productname>/Sybase environment.
			</para>
			<para>
The <filename>interfaces</filename> is not read by <productname>FreeTDS</productname> unless it does not find <filename>freetds.conf</filename>.  Note also that <command>make install</command> will install a skeleton <filename>freetds.conf</filename>, which you'll have to remove if you want to use <filename>interfaces</filename> instead.  
			</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="interfaceslocation">
			<title>Where it goes</title>
			<para>
Anywhere.  The <envar>SYBASE</envar> environment variable must contain the location of  <filename>interfaces</filename>; that is how <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will find it.  
			</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="interfacespurpose">
			<title>What it does</title>
			<para>
The <filename>interfaces</filename> file aliases a dataserver name to the hostname and port number of the dataserver's machine.  When <productname>FreeTDS</productname> receives a request to connect to a database server, it looks up the dataserver name in <filename>interfaces</filename>.  There, it finds the machine name (or address) and port number to connect to, that is, the port where the database server is listening.  
			</para>

			<tip><sidebar><title>How's that again?</title>
			<para>
The <filename>interfaces</filename> file sometimes trips people up.  It seems innocuous enough, but it's also a pretty good example of <quote>it's easy if you know how</quote>.  Keep in mind:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
				<listitem><para>The <emphasis>dataserver name</emphasis> is the name of the database server.  When a database client specifies the <quote>name of the server</quote> to connect to, it's the <emphasis>dataserver name</emphasis> that is used.  
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>The <emphasis>host name</emphasis> is the name of the host (machine) where the database server is running.  It has an IP address, and in almost any environment, you can <command>ping</command> the machine name to see if you've got it right.  After it uses the <emphasis>dataserver name</emphasis>  to look up the <emphasis>host name</emphasis>, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will do the same thing <command>ping</command> does to get the IP address of the machine to connect to. 
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Finally, the <emphasis>port number</emphasis> is frequently overlooked.  From the network's point of view, knowing the IP address without the port number is a little like knowing the address of an apartment building without knowing the apartment number.  In both cases, it will be hard to find what you came for.  Make sure you <emphasis>know</emphasis> the port number, and that it's correctly entered in the <filename>interfaces</filename> file.  
					</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</sidebar></tip>
			</sect1>

			<sect1 id="interfacesformat">
			<title>What it looks like</title>
			<para>
The format of the  <filename>interfaces</filename> file is borrowed directly from that used by Sybase on Unix platforms (<productname>Windows</productname> has a different format).  Additionally, we have overloaded one of the fields to add the ability to set the protocol version.  An example <filename>interfaces</filename> file looks like this.
			</para>
			<para>
<example>
<title>An <filename>interfaces</filename> file example</title>

	master tcp ether 127.0.0.1 4000
</programlisting>
</example>
			</para>
			<para>
The entry starts with the servername beginning in the first column (no 
whitespace preceding it).  Following the servername are one or more services lines which <emphasis>must</emphasis> be indented with whitespace.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> uses only the query line, although others may be present to retain compatibility with Sybase.

In the example above, the <literal>hostname</literal> was entered as an IP address.

	<Appendix><title>About Unicode, UCS-2, and UTF-8</title>
			<para>
For better or worse, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> brings the otherwise innocent programmer into contact with the arcane business of how data are stored and transported.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> is a data communications library that of course connects to databases, which are charged with storing information in a way that is neutral to all architectures and languages.  On the surface, that might not seem very complex, even worth discussing.  Under the surface, things are not so simple.  
			</para>
		<section id="ascii"><title><acronym>ASCII</>: What everyone knows</title>
			<para>
The world we are all familiar with, programmingwise, is <acronym>ASCII</>.  Our email (mostly), our <quote>text</quote> files, our web pages, all use <acronym>ASCII</> to represent English (or English-like) text. Perhaps because <ulink url="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html"><acronym>ASCII</></ulink> was standardized back in 1972 by the ISO, it seems like the <quote>natural</quote> way to store information.  But let's look under the hood a little bit, and examine our assumptions.  
			</para>
			<para>
Our so-called <quote>text</quote> files are nothing special, nothing but a little agreement we enter into with our operating system.  The only reason we can <quote>read</quote> them with <command>cat</command> or <command>vi</command> is that the operating system and its tools are in on the agreement.  A file is only a stream of bytes, after all, no more <quote>text</quote> than an executable.  The only thing distinguishing a <quote>text</quote> file from any other, is our understanding to treat it like one.  We agree that the number 65 will represent the letter <literal>A</literal>, 66, <literal>B</literal>, and so on, 127 values in all.  See <command>man ascii</command> for further details.  
			</para>
			<para>
The important thing to understand is that the designation of 65 for <literal>A</literal> and so on is a choice.  It's an <emphasis>encoding standard</emphasis>, made necessary by the old simple fact that computers store numbers, not letters.  <acronym>ASCII</> is so ubiquitous these days that it's hard sometimes to remember there was a time when it was but one of a set of competing encoding standards.  Others you probably have heard of include <acronym>EBCDIC</> and the Baudot systems, but they are by no means the only historical alternatives, nor the only modern ones.  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="ISO8859"><title>ISO 8859: What everyone would like to forget</title>
			<para>
<acronym>ASCII</> won, it would seem, but the race goes not to the swift.  <acronym>ASCII</> has many limitations, the most egregious of which is, it's not much good for anything besides English.  It encodes all the letters and punctuation (almost) of the English alphabet, but is useless for German, Russian, and Greek, to say nothing of Chinese.  
			</para>
			<para>
<acronym>ASCII</> assigns one byte to every character, but deals only with 7 of the 8 available bits, the range 0-127 (with the <quote>high bit</quote> always zero).  Demand for computers that could display and print languages besides English -- even English with em dashes and cent (&cent;) signs -- arrived soon enough, with the Marketing Department way out in front of the propeller heads.  The predictable result was an array of <quote>8-bit <acronym>ASCII</></quote> encoding standards for a wide variety of non-English languages, notably excluding ideographic languages such as Chinese.  Eventually, they were standardized (or at least enumerated and documented) by the ISO.  These are what our friendly database vendors are referring to when they talk about <emphasis>character sets</emphasis>.  More information on this subject can be found at <ulink url="http://www.webreference.com/dlab/books/html/39-1.html">webreference.com</ulink>.  
	
			</para>
			<para>
The upshot is, there is no uniform standard, no agreement on the meaning of a byte, particularly if that byte's value is greater than 127.  Let's say your client machine sends <literal>HELLO</literal> and your database stores it as  <literal>72 69 76 76 79</literal>.  When another client retrieves that value, it will convert it into human-readable form by applying an encoding standard.  If everything's tightly wrapped, it will use the very same encoding that your database used (and the same one you had in mind when you sent it), and that client will also see <literal>HELLO</literal>.  If things are not so tightly wrapped but that client is fortunate enough to be using a similar standard to what you were using, say, ISO 8859-1, he'll still see <literal>HELLO</literal>.  Most languages based on the Roman alphabet can be represented by ISO 8859-1, and are thus interchangeable.  Beyond that, things get quickly messy.  Greek clients, for one, are not so lucky: there are three ISO 8859 standards for Greek, all mutually incompatible.  

For more information, see <ulink url="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html">ISO 8859 Alphabet Soup</ulink>.  Roman Czyborra's site is very informative; take your time there if you don't want your head to spin.  
			</para>
			<para>
Database servers need to know what encoding standard to employ, too.  It's not obvious at first, but notions like <quote>uppercase</quote> and <quote>lowercase</quote>, trailing blanks, and collation rules all depend on what letter is meant by what number.  (Collation even depends on what culture is interpreting the letters.)  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="Unicode"><title>Unicode: East meets West</title>

<acronym>ASCII</> and its 8-bit cousins are on the way out, and with them the assumption that a character can be represented by a single byte.  The new kid on the block is <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</ulink>, similar to but not precisely the same as ISO 10646.  Unicode (despite its name) is a set of standards.  The most widely implemented is the 16-bit form, called UCS-2.  As you might guess, UCS-2 uses two bytes per character, allowing it to encode most characters of most languages.  Because <quote>most</quote> is far from <emphasis>all</emphasis>, there are nascent 32-bit forms, too, but they are neither complete nor in common use.  
			</para>
			<para>
In the same sense that 7-bit <acronym>ASCII</> was extended to 8 bits, Unicode extends the most prevalent <quote>8-bit <acronym>ASCII</></quote>,  <acronym>ISO-8859-1</>, to 16 and 32 bits.  The first 256 values remain in Unicode as in <acronym>ISO-8859-1</>: 65 is still <literal>A</literal>, except instead of being 8 bits (0x40), it's 16 bits (0x0040).  Unlike the 8-bit extensions, Unicode has a unique 1:1 map of numbers to characters, so no language context or <quote>character set</quote> name is needed to decode a Unicode string.  
			</para>
			<para>
UCS-2 is the system employed by Microsoft NT-based systems.  Microsoft database servers store UCS-2 strings in <type>nchar</type> and <type>nvarchar</type> datatypes.  Microsoft also designed version 7.0 (and up) of the <acronym>TDS</> protocol around UCS-2: all character data are encoded according to UCS-2 on the wire.  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="Unicodegoodbad"><title>Unicode's Pluses and Minuses</title>
			<para>
You will read from time to time that Unicode is not perfect.  Surprise, surprise: it's true.  From a linguistic point of view, Unicode is incomplete; in particular, UCS-2 is demonstrably too small (!) to hold all the forms of Chinese ideographs used over the centuries.  (It is, however, quite useful and widely employed in representing modern Chinese.)  Of more common concern to programmers are Unicode's technical problems, or rather, Unix's technical shortcomings <foreignphrase>vis-a-vis</foreignphrase> any encoding more complex than <acronym>ISO-8859-x</>.  
			</para>
			<para>
The basic problem, from a programmer's perspective, is the ancient agreement Unix entered into 30 years ago, the <quote><acronym>ASCII</> Compact,</quote> if you will.  Assumptions about <acronym>ASCII</> are littered throughout Unix-like systems, beginning with C's convention of representing strings as arrays of characters ending in a zero.  Returning to our HELLO example earlier, C will store <literal>HELLO</literal> as  <literal>72 69 76 76 79 0</literal>, in very nice <acronym>ASCII</>.  Many many parts of the operating system and its associated tools and applications will recognize that as a 5-letter word because it's terminated by a null (zero).  In UCS-2 Unicode, though, that same <literal>HELLO</literal> uses 2 bytes for every character and becomes <literal>72 0 69 0 76 0 76 0 79 0 0 0</literal>.  Practically the whole OS will think that's a 1-letter word, <quote>H</quote>.  Not a good thing.  
			</para>
			<para>
Even if every OS were magically rid of all <acronym>ASCII</> assumptions and C strings, there would still be the problem of Endianism.  <ulink url="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci211659,00.html">Technical</ulink> <ulink url="http://www.noveltheory.com/TechPapers/endian.asp">explanations</ulink> on the subject are not hard to find.  The long and short of it is, given a 16-bit integer (2 bytes), different hardware architectures will store the value differently.  Asked to store our friend <quote>A</quote>, (0x41), for instance, a Sparc processor will put the least significant byte at the higher address (00 41) whereas an Intel processor will put it in the lower address (41 00).  Put aside the questions of left, right, and wrong; architectures are a fact of life.  Endianism shows up wherever integers are stored and retrieved in heterogeneous environments.  
			</para>
			<para>
The Unicode folks knew about Endianism, of course, and had to address it.  A Unicode bytestream is supposed to begin with a byte-order mark.  Needless to say, perhaps, many don't.  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="UnicodeUtf"><title>Unicode Transformation Format: UTF-8</title>
			<para>
The presence of nulls embedded in character data and of byte order issues make straight Unicode i.e., UCS-2 or UCS-4 hard to work with in a heterogeneous environment.  Too many opportunities arise for the data to be truncated or misinterpreted, and too many systems would fail even to transmit such data.  In short, when 16-bit data are thrust into a multi-architecture 8-bit world, it frequently bodes ill for the data.  
			</para>
			<para>
To answer that problem, to make Unicode transmissible and unambiguous to most machines, several <quote>transformation formats</quote> were adopted.  Their goals were generally similar: to create a generally recognized format that would unambiguously and safely convey Unicode information between machines and across the Internet.  To do that, they sought to remove nulls and endianism from the data stream.  The most popular one -- practically the only one used -- is known as UTF-8.  
			</para>
			<para>
UTF-8 found wide acceptance for many reasons.  UTF-8 represents any Unicode character as a combination of 1-4 bytes.  The number of bytes required depends on the integer value of the Unicode character, and only one byte is used to represent the old <acronym>ASCII</> range (0-127).  UTF-8 does not use zero to represent any part of any character (except for the <acronym>ASCII</> NUL).  In consequence, UTF-8 is efficient with respect to space, has no endianism issues, and embeds no nulls.  UTF-8 strings can be treated as plain old <acronym>ASCII</> strings.  These properties make UTF-8 data relatively easy for systems accustomed to processing <acronym>ASCII</> data.  
			</para>
			<para>
Here's a small example showing the difference between UCS-2 and UTF-8.  
			<example>
<title><quote>HELLO</quote> in UCS-2 and UTF-8</title>
<screen>
$ echo HELLO | iconv -f ascii -t UCS-2 | hexdump -C
00000000  00 48 00 45 00 4c 00 4c  00 4f 00 0a              |.H.E.L.L.O..|
0000000c
$ echo HELLO | iconv -f ascii -t utf-8 | hexdump -C
00000000  48 45 4c 4c 4f 0a                                 |HELLO.|
00000006
$ echo HELLO | hexdump -C
00000000  48 45 4c 4c 4f 0a                                 |HELLO.|
00000006
</screen>
			</example>
It is the similarity of the last two outputs that makes UTF-8 so attractive.  It behaves like <acronym>ASCII</> when <acronym>ASCII</>'s all that's needed.  But it lacks <acronym>ASCII</>'s limitations.  			</para>
			<para>
While UTF-8 solves many technical problems, it doesn't magically transform every <acronym>ASCII</>-assuming system into a Unicode system.  For example, to display Unicode data -- even Unicode data in UTF-8 format -- correctly, the system still needs a suitable font.  And it must distinguish the buffer size (and byte count) from the character count.  
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="UnicodeFreeTDS"><title>Unicode and FreeTDS</title>
			<para>
Microsoft servers using TDS 7.0 and above (anything since SQL Server 6.5) transmit their data in UCS-2 format (16-bit integers).  Because most application linked to <productname>FreeTDS</productname> are not prepared to deal with UCS-2 data, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> can convert the data to something more acceptable, including <acronym>ASCII</>.  To do so, it employs an  <productname>iconv</productname>  library; one is available (and frequently employed) from GNU.  The <quote>to</quote> format for <productname>iconv</productname> can be set in <filename>freetds.conf</filename>.  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> will happily convert and convey your data in any <emphasis>single-byte</emphasis> format that <productname>iconv</productname> can provide.  In practice, this normally means some form of ISO 8859-x or UTF-8.  
			</para>
			<para>
At some future time, <productname>FreeTDS</productname> aims to support Unicode and other multi-byte character sets.  It does not do so at the current time.  
			</para>
			<para>
Sybase servers, by the way, transmit their data in the character set requested by the client at login time.  The available character sets is fairly small, but includes UTF-8.  While  <productname>FreeTDS</productname> <emphasis>could</emphasis> convert Sybase data streams as easily as it does Microsoft data streams, to our knowledge no one is doing so.  The Sybase server can perform the conversion itself, making <productname>FreeTDS</productname>'s capability in this regard largely redundant and irrelevant.

    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by

    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.

    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the

    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-11">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote id="sample-copyright"><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
