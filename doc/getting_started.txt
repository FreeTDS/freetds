Introduction
------------

This document is intended for people who want to help on the FreeTDS project and/or are interested in how the code works.

TDS is a fairly simple request/response protocol. It comes in three major 
flavors: 4.2, 5.0 and 7.0.  Microsoft SQL-Server versions through 6.5 still use 
the 4.2 version as do Sybase servers before 10.0.  MS SQL 7.0 introduced TDS 7.0
which so far is not implemented (but can still be accessed with 4.2). No version
of MS SQL uses 5.0 and Sybase does not use 7.0, but both still support 4.2.
TDS allows for negotiation of quite a few parameters at connection time, many of
these are documented in the cap.txt file in this directory.

* Sybase ASA 5.5 requires 5.5.03 or better with the OpenServer Gateway 
(OSG).


Layers
------

The FreeTDS code is broken down into two layers.

The TDS layer handles the bulk of the processing of the protocol and dealing with the network, etc... Any code dealing with protocol issues should reside in this directory (src/tds). A related directory src/server has routines that are used
only for server side processes.  These two directories may eventually be merged.

On top of this layer is a thin layer specific to the 'Call Level Interface' (CLI).  A CLI is an API intended to be used by client programs.  The core FreeTDS 
has three CLIs: dblib, the original Sybase API; ctlib, the newer Sybase API; and
ODBC, the non-database specific API.

Currently dblib and ODBC are the most robust CLIs we have, followed by ctlib, which is
quite usable none-the-less.  The ODBC CLI is built using a driver manager (either iODBC or
unixODBC), so you will need one of those to build it with.

Outside of these there is also a JDBC driver for Java and a DBI driver for 
Perl which do not reside atop the TDS layer. (FreeTDS/JDBC is a pure Java
driver).  This document does not currently cover these libraries.  Those wishing
to use Perl are also encouraged to look at DBD::Sybase which uses ctlib and works well with the FreeTDS libraries.

The Nitty Gritty
----------------

The first thing a CLI does is allocate a login structure for TDS.  Such as:

	TDS_LOGIN *login = tds_alloc_login();

It can then call any of the tds_set_*() functions to initialize this TDS_LOGIN 
structure.  Please refer to src/tds/login.c for a complete listing of options.

Once username, password, server, and other options are set a call can be made to
tds_connect(). This will allocate a TDS_SOCKET structure and open a socket 
connection to the specified server (or NULL on failure). The TDS_SOCKET is then
passed as an argument to all future TDS functions.

At this point the only really useful thing to do is to call tds_submit_query()
and then process the returning rows using tds_process_results() and company.

This should get us to the routines in src/tds/token.c which are responsible for
reading the results back from the server and doing something with them.  The 
logic in these routines should not be hard to follow.  The return stream is 
broken up into a series of 'messages' (not to be confused with actual messages
returned from the server). Each one starts with a marker (marker is my word for
it, not Sybase's or anyone else's).  include/tds.h defines all the markers and in
general there will be one tds_process_*() function for each marker unless it is
not worth looking at, in which case tds_process_default_tokens() will read past
it.

I realize it's a little rough right now but I wanted to at least put something
out.
