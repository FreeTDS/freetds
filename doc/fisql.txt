DESCRIPTION

	fisql is very similar to the "isql" 
	utility programs distributed by Sybase and Microsoft. Like them, fisql uses
	the command "go" on a line by itself as a separator between batches. 

OPTIONS

	-a display_charset  The client charset name. Not implemented. 

	-c cmdend  Command terminator, defaults to go. 

	-e  Echo SQL input (usually in outputfile)

	-E editor  Specify an editor to invoke. Defaults to vi. 

	-F  FIPS mode ON. Server returns a message (but processes the query anyway) 
			when it encounters a non-standard SQL command. 

	-g  Display a brief help message

	-h headers  Number of rows after which to repeat the column headers. Default is once per resultset. 

	-H hostname  Hostname of the client machine as it will be told to the server. 

	-I interfaces_file  Name of the interfaces or freetds.conf file to use. 

	-i inputfile  Name of script file, containing SQL.

	-J client_charset  Not implemented. 

	-l login_timeout  How long to wait for the server to acknowledge a login attempt. 

	-m errorlevel  For errors of the severity level specified or higher, 
			print only the message number, state, and error level. 
			Below that level, print nothing. 

	-n  Suppress line numbers in echoed output. 

	-o outputfile  Name of output file, holding result data.

	-p  Prints performance statistics. Not implemented.

	-P password   Database server password.

	-s colseparator  The column separator. Default is space. Shell metacharacters require quoting. 

	-S server       Database server to which to connect.

	-t timeout  The query timeout, in seconds. How long to wait for a query to be processed. 
			The default is indefinitely, or as determined by freetds.conf. 

	-U username   Database server login name.

	-v  Display version and copyright. 

	-w width  How many characters wide to print the output. Defaults to 80. 

	-X  Use encrypted login. Not implemented in FreeTDS. 

	-y sybase_dir  Sets the SYBASE environment variable. Not used by FreeTDS. 

	-Y  Use chained transactions. 

	-z language  Name of a language for fisql's prompts and messages. 
	   Cf. DBSETLNATLANG. 

NOTES
  fisql is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard output, 
  and writes errors to standard error. The -i, -o, and -e options override 
  these, of course.

  fisql uses the db-lib API provided by FreeTDS. It was first implemented using 
  Sybase's own library and continues to work with it. Before (and after) modifying 
  it, it would be well to test it with Sybase's library to assure compatibility 
  between it and FreeTDS. 

EXIT STATUS
  fisql exits 0 on success, and >0 if the server cannot process the query.

  fisql will report any errors returned by the server, but will continue
  processing. In a production environment, this behavior may be insufficiently
  stringent. To make it extremely intolerant of errors, change the message and
  error handlers to call exit(3). 

HISTORY
  fisql first appeared in FreeTDS 0.65.

AUTHORS
  The fisql utility was written by Nicholas S. Castellano <entropy@freetds.org>, 
  who contributed it to the FreeTDS project under the terms of the GPL. 

BUGS
  Doesn't handle compute rows.
  Requires the GNU readline library.
