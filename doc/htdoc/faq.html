  <h2>General Questions</h2>

  <h3>What is FreeTDS?</h3>
  	<a name="What.is.FreeTDS" id="What.is.FreeTDS"></a>

  <p>FreeTDS is a free implementation of the TDS (Tabular Data
  Stream) protocol that is used by Sybase and Microsoft for their
  database products. It implements TDS 4.2, 5.0, 7.0 and
  8.0, and can communicate with any Sybase or Microsoft SQL
  Server.</p>

  <p>FreeTDS comes with a low level library (the TDS layer) along
  with a number of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The
  APIs are DB-Lib, CT-Lib, and ODBC.</p>

  <h3>Where do I get FreeTDS?</h3>
  	<a name="Where.do.I.get.FreeTDS" id="Where.do.I.get.FreeTDS"></a>

  <p>You can get the latest FreeTDS from <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/freetds/stable/freetds-stable.tgz">
  Ibiblio</a> or its mirrors. See "Quick Links" on the <a href=
  "/">FreeTDS</a> home page. You may also use
  the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group.id=33106">CVS
  repository</a> (on sourceforge.net); see the 
  <a href="userguide/">User Guide</a> for details.</p>

  <p>Your favorite operating system may have a package of some kind
  available. You might want to check there. Occasionally someone
  contributes a package here, which we keep around. Post a message
  to the list if you're looking for one and don't find one in the
  usual places.</p>

  <h3>Does FreeTDS support Microsoft servers?</h3>
  	<a name="Does.FreeTDS.support.Microsoft.servers"></a>

  <p>Yes. Microsoft servers don't usually accept TDS 5.0
  connections. Use one of versions 4.2, 7.0 or 8.0 of the protocol.
  See the <a href=
  "userguide/choosingtdsprotocol.htm">User
  Guide</a> for details.</p>

  <h3>How can I get help (or support)?</h3>
	<a name="How.can.I.get.help" id="How.can.I.get.help"></a>
	
  <p>After reading this FAQ and the User Guide, you might want to
  look at the mailing list <a href=
  "http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/freetds/">archives</a>. If
  you don't see your question answered there (or, if you'd just
  like to learn more about what's going on with FreeTDS), please
  subscribe to the <a href=
  "contact.html">mailing list</a>. Questions
  new and old are cheerfully answered there. Traffic is not high,
  normally around 10 messages a day.</p>

  <p><i>Netiquette note</i>: It's considered poor form to mail
  "help me" questions directly to the developers of <i>any</i> free
  software project, this one included. Please direct your question
  to the list, where someone with the available time and expertise
  can help you.</p>

  <h3>Why LGPL license?</h3>
  	<a name="license" id="license"></a>

  <p>Brian Bruns started the project, and that's the choice he
  made. LGPL was chosen because if you want a commercial client,
  you can buy them from Sybase, Microsoft or others. "I do believe
  BSDish licenses are better in some cases, but not for something
  like this," he said.</p>

  <h3>What is this <code>SYBASE</code> environment variable?</h3>

  <p>Many programs look for the <var>SYBASE</var> environment
  variable in order to find the library's home. You will want to
  set this to the main FreeTDS directory. For example, if
  <code>FreeTDS</code> is installed in <tt>/usr/local/freetds</tt>
  (meaning the libraries were installed in
  <tt>/usr/local/freetds/lib</tt>), then your <var>SYBASE</var>

  <p>One small PHP hint, mailed to the FAQ master in May 2001:</p>

  <p>In the mailing list archives I noticed a few people discussing
  a problem I just had.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>An attempt to make a connection to a MS SQL server from PHP
    would fail, leaving a message in the Apache error log:</p>
    <pre>
        "connect: Network is unreachable
         DB-Library: Login incorrect"
</pre>

    <p>The problem turned out to be a very simple one to fix. In
    the php.ini file under the sybase section, there is a directive
    that sets the path to the sybase interfaces file
    "sybase.interface_file = "</p>

    <p>After uncommenting this and setting it to a reasonable value
    (ie. /usr/local/freetds/interfaces), things started
    working.</p>
  </blockquote><a name="Which.API" id="Which.API"></a>

  <h3>How should I choose among <tt>db-lib</tt>, <tt>ct-lib</tt>,
  and <tt>ODBC</tt></h3>

  <p><tt>FreeTDS</tt> offers three client libraries and one
  internal one (<tt>libtds</tt>). We generally encourage people to
  use one of the client libraries, and discourage writing to
  <tt>libtds</tt>, because the latter is evolving, more subject to
  change, less well documented, and harder to use. In choosing
  which client API to write to, you might want to peruse our
  <a href="which_api.html">brief discussion</a>. </p>

  <h3 id="Where.is.libtds.so">
  	Where is <kbd>libtds.so</kbd>?</h3>
	
  <p>As of version 0.82, the TDS utility library is not built 
  as a shared object.  There is a static library <kbd>libtds.a</kbd>, 
  although it's not installed by <b><kbd>make install</kbd></b>.  
  <kbd>libtds</kbd> is statically linked to the "official" client 
  libraries, <kbd>ct-lib</kbd>, <kbd>db-lib</kbd>, and <kbd>ODBC</kbd>.  
  
  <p>Distributing <kbd>libtds</kbd> as a shared object did more harm
  than good.  Proper versioning and support was a burden on the 
  developers, and it was just one more thing for a client application
  to link in.  The only benefit was to programs that use more than
  one client library. 
  
  <p>Of course, it's still free software, and you're free to build a 
  shared object of it if you want to.  It's just not done "out of the box"
  by the distributed makefiles.  

  <h3>Which Perl library should I use?</h3>
	<a name="Which.Perl.library.should.I.use" 
	     id="Which.Perl.library.should.I.use"></a>

  <p>There are four options for using TDS and Perl to connect to a
  Sybase or MSSQL database, DBD::Sybase, DBD::ODBC, DBD::FreeTDS,
  and Sybperl.</p>

  <p>From Mark Schaal:<br /></p>

  <p>DBD::Sybase is the recommended option, and yes it does work
  with MSSQL. You will need to install the perl DBI module and the
  FreeTDS package, particularly the CTLib portion. Set your SYBASE
  environment variable to /usr/local/freetds and install
  DBD::Sybase. Don't worry too much if some of the tests fail. Do
  worry if the module doesn't compile. Make sure you have the most
  recent version of FreeTDS installed. You can check the <a href=
  "http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/freetds/">mailing list
  archives</a> or ask the mailing list for help.</p>

  <p>DBD::FreeTDS does not depend on the FreeTDS libraries. It is
  minimally functional but it is considered alpha software and is
  not being actively developed.</p>

  <p>From <a href="mailto:mpeppler@peppler.org">Michael
  Peppler</a>:<br />
  Sybperl is a thin wrapper around the Sybase C APIs. It's a lot
  more mature than DBI/DBD::Sybase (I've been working on it for 9
  years :-) and it's maybe more natural to use for someone who
  already knows the Sybase APIs (or MS's DBlibrary). It's a little
  more powerful/flexible than DBI, though obviously less portable.
  It's still actively maintained and developed (by yours truly)</p>

  <p>From Brian:<br />
  DBD::ODBC is the newest option available. Its primary advantage
  is not having to load another DBI driver if you already have
  DBI::ODBC load for other systems. On the downside, it may be a
  little less robust than DBD::Sybase.</p>

  <h3>Are there any known issues?</h3>
  	<a name="Are.there.any.known.issues" 
	     id="Are.there.any.known.issues"></a>
  <ul>
    <li>ODBC can be confusing to set up. See the <tt>samples</tt>
    directory for example <tt>.ini</tt> files, and follow the User
    Guide's instructions carefully.</li>

    <li>BCP of text and image types is broken for
    Microsoft servers.</li>

    <li>BCP does not support TDS 4.2. You must use a more modern
    protocol version.</li>

    <li>Server-side cursors work only in ct-lib.</li>

    <li>ODBC lacks a client-side cursor implementation.</li>

    <li>DBD::Sybase dynamic SQL placeholders don't work, pending a client-side SQL parser.  (The ODBC ones do.)</li>

    <li>There are no plans to implement db-lib's browse mode.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Errors can sometimes be confusing. When an application uses
  the library incorrectly, or when there are problems in a data
  file being uploaded with BCP, the message returned by FreeTDS can
  sometimes be misleading. In the latter case, it's often necessary
  to examine the log file to understand what went wrong. </p>

  <h3>Why does each connection support only one query at a time?</h3>
	<a name="pending" id="pending"></a>

  <p>If you are accustomed to programming with other database
  servers, you may be surprised when you first encounter this
  aspect of the TDS protocol. When a TDS server&mdash;be it by
  Microsoft or Sybase&mdash;responds to a query, it may send a result
  set to the client. The server does not construct a complete
  result set first, unless it needs to (say, to execute an
  <tt>ORDER BY</tt> clause). Instead, it sends the rows as they're
  selected/formed, in real time (if you will). Likewise, the client
  libraries do <i>not</i> read all the rows from the server before
  making them available to the client application.</p>

  <p>The client library is tightly coupled to the server; they are
  synchronized, share state information. The server requires the
  client either to read all the results from a query, or to
  indicate that no further rows are desired i.e., to issue a
  cancellation. Until one of those two things happens, the server
  will not accept new queries on that connection. It will complain
  about "pending results".</p>

  <p>How do mortal programmers cope with this strict
  one-query-at-a-time limitation? For one thing, they become better
  programmers.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The solution often involves doing more SQL work, which
    often results in less interaction with the server, which is
    almost always faster.</li>

    <li>Even when that's not true, there's nothing to prevent the
    application from caching the whole results set in its own
    collection object.</li>

    <li>Sometimes, the best answer is to open a new connection.
    That's not as bad as it sounds, and it certainly not unheard of
    to have 4 or more simultaneous connections supporting an
    application.</li>
  </ul>It's important to realize that the selection of rows and
  their accumulation into a container of some sort are two
  different functions. A TDS server issues its results a row at a
  time, which the client library dutifully makes available to the
  application on arrival. It's up to the application&mdash;or a
  higher-level library&mdash;to form a "rowset" of some kind if
  desired.

  <h4>PHP note</h4>If you use PHP, you will still run into this
  problem even if you create a new connection. The reason is that
  PHP is so nice that it will re-use the first connection if you
  connect again with the same parameters. You my wish to refer to

  <h3>Is FreeTDS thread safe?</h3>
	<a name="thread.safe" id="thread.safe"></a>

  <p>Different threads may all use separate connections without
  interfering with each other. Threads may not share a DBPROCESS or
  CS_CONNECTION without controlling access via a mutex.</p>

  <h3>Are there plans to implement the OpenServer protocol/library?</h3>
  	<a name="Are.there.plans.to.implement.the.OpenServer.protocol.library"></a>

  <p>Not at this point, there is still much work to do on the
  client protocol. But, <tt>libtdssrv</tt> will do the trick for
  some applications.</p>

  <h3>Output Parameters</h3>

  <p><i>I'm not getting my output parameters returned, but I seem
         to be doing everything right!</i> </p> 
  <p>That's not a question!</p>
  <p>Microsoft SQL Server 7 with SP3, and later versions, quietly changed (which is to say, broke) how they respond to queries that execute stored procedures with output parameters.  Earlier servers let you send a query like <font size="-1"><code>EXECUTE A @P OUTPUT</code></font> and fetch the output parameter as a special result row (technique varying by library).  Newer servers simply don't send back that data.  To elicit output parameters from them, you have to use the RPC protocols such as the db-lib <a href="reference/a00336.html#a129">dbrpcparam</a>.

  <h3>What does this <tt>unknown marker</tt> message mean?</h3>
	<a name="unknownmarker" id="unknownmarker"></a>  

  <p>Most of the time, it means you're not using the right protocol
  version. That <i>can</i> happen even if your <tt>./configure</tt>
  was done correctly. Try setting the <tt>TDSVER</tt> variable to a
  value appropriate for your server: normally <code>5.0</code> for
  Sybase and <code>7.0</code> for Microsoft. If that works, double
  check your work. If your <kbd>freetds.conf</kbd> file and
  <kbd><strong>configure</strong></kbd> options were right, but you
  needed the environment variable anyway, please post a message to
  the list and help us track it down.</p>

  <h3>What if I get a <tt><font size="+1">connection
      refused</font></tt> message?</h3>
	<a name="connectionrefused" id="connectionrefused"></a>

  <p>You want to make sure:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>your server is running,</li>

    <li>you can connect to it,</li>

    <li>your account has permissions in the database to execute
    your query.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Try <tt><b>telnet <i>hostmachine port</i></b></tt> and
    see if it's listening. You should get some form of response
    from the server (actual text varies by vendor &amp;
    version).<br /></li>

    <li>
      <p>Try <kbd><b>tsql -H <i>hostmachine</i> -p <i>port</i> -U
      <i>username</i> -P <i>password</i></b></kbd></p>

      <p>That will connect to the server, bypassing the
      freetds.conf file. If it doesn't work, the problem lies
      upstream.</p></li>

    <li>
      <p>Try <kbd><b>tsql -S <i>servername</i> -p <i>port</i> -U
      <i>username</i> -P <i>password</i></b></kbd></p>

      <p>That will connect to the server using freetds.conf. This
      allows you to isolate freetds.conf mistakes. <kbd>man
      tsql</kbd> for more.</p></li>

    <li>Check your ./configure and environment variables. The
    <tt>--with-tdsver</tt> determines what flavor of the TDS
    protocol your runs by default; the $TDSVER variable overrides
    that default. The following combinations are reasonable; see
    the <a href="userguide/">User Guide</a>
    for details:</li>

    <li style="list-style: none">
      <table summary="TDS Protocol Versions">
        <tr>
          <td><b>Vendor</b></td>

          <td><b>Version</b></td>

          <td><b>TDS Version</b></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Sybase</td>

          <td>4.92+&nbsp;</td>

          <td>5.0</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Microsoft</td>

          <td>6.0, 6.5</td>

          <td>4.2</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Microsoft</td>

          <td>7.0/2000</td>

          <td>7.0</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Edit the <b><tt>PWD</tt></b> file and try <tt>make
      check</tt>. It will call unittests for libtds, ctlib, dblib
      and odbc in that order</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Compile <font size="+1"><tt><a href=
      "http://www.sqsh.org">sqsh</a></tt></font> and try that
      before the more complicated stuff (PHP/Perl). If you can
      connect with <tt>sqsh</tt>, you don't have a FreeTDS
      problem.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The Microsoft SQL Server is listening, my configuration and
      environment are set up per question 6.1, but logins still
      fail.</h3>
	<a name="integratedsecurity" id="integratedsecurity"></a>

  <p>Microsoft supports two security models in three
  permutations:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Windows NT Authentication Mode (Windows NT
    Authentication)</li>

    <li>Standard Mode (SQL Server Authentication)</li>

    <li>Mixed Mode (Windows NT Authentication and SQL Server
    Authentication)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>"Windows NT Authentication", often called "integrated
  security", relies on Microsoft's domain logins, which establish a
  user's network security attributes at network login time. When
  connecting to the database server, SQL Server accepts an
  encrypted password in the login packet, and uses Windows NT
  facilities authenticate it, usually via the Primary Domain
  Controller (PDC). The server then permits or denies login access
  based on the response.</p>

  <p>With traditional "Standard Mode" authentication, usernames and
  passwords are stored within SQL Server. They are passed in the
  login packet as plaintext, and connection requests are
  authenticated without consulting the operating system.</p>

  <p>FreeTDS supports both security models. Domain logins are
  recognized by the presence of a backslash (\) character in the
  username. See the <a href=
  "userguide/domains.htm">User Guide</a> for
  details. <a name="textdata" id="textdata"></a></p>

  <h3>My <tt>text</tt> data are being truncated or are causing my
  client to break.</h3>

  <p>The <tt>text</tt> data type is different from <tt>char</tt>
  and <tt>varchar</tt> types. The maximum data length of a
  <tt>text</tt> column is governed by the <tt>textsize</tt>
  connection option. Microsoft <i>claims</i> in their
  documentation to use a default <tt>textsize</tt> of 4000
  characters, but in fact their implementation is inconsistent.
  Sometimes <tt>text</tt> columns are returned with a size of 4
  GB!</p>

  <p>The best solution is to make sure you set the <tt>textsize</tt> option to
  a reasonable value when establishing a connection. For
  example:</p>
  <pre class="screen">
<tt class="userinput">
1&gt; <b>set <tt class="envar">textsize</tt> 10000</b></tt>
2&gt; <b>go</b>
</pre>

  See also the &ldquo;<tt>text size</tt>&rdquo; option in <tt>freetds.conf</tt>.

  <h3>My dates aren't formatted right!</h3>
  	<a name="dateformat" id="dateformat"></a>

  <p>Some dates turn out better than others.</p>

  <p>If you think your dates should look like <em>2001-12-13
  17:58:55.000</em>, but you're seeing something like <em>Dec 13
  2001 05:58PM</em> instead (or vice versa), you've bumped into
  driver behavior. There's no standard governing the default
  character string representation of a <code>datetime</code>
  datatype. Different drivers make different choices, and your
  driver has chosen a representation for you.</p>Microsoft's ODBC
  driver (which is used by among other things the Query Analyzer
  tool) converts <tt>datetime</tt> to an ISO format. That format
  has the advantages of being all numeric: sortable, unambiguous,
  and locale-independent. The vendors' <code>db-lib</code> and
  <code>ct-lib</code>, in contrast, use the <code>MMM DD YYYY
  hh:mm</code> format.

  <p>If you want to be sure your queries always return dates in a
  particular format, don't leave the formatting up to the driver!
  Use the <code>convert</code> function. For example:</p>
  <!-- example convert  -->
  <pre class="screen">
<tt class="userinput">
1&gt; <b>select convert( varchar(30), getdate(), 120 ) as Now</b>
2&gt; <b>go</b>
 Now
 ------------------------------
 2002-07-02 12:36:31
</tt>
</pre>

  <p>As of version 0.60, the default datetime-&gt;string conversion
  is controlled by the <code>locale.conf</code> file. See the User
  Guide for details.</p><!-- footer -->
