NAME
  bsqldb - batch SQL script processor using db-lib

SYNOPSIS
  bsqldb [-U username] [-P password] [-S server] [-D database]
         [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-e error_file] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
  bsqldb is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS.

  bsqldb is a non-interactive equivalent of the "isql" 
  utility programs distributed by Sybase and Microsoft. Like them, bsqldb uses
  the command "go" on a line by itself as a separator between batches. The last
  batch need not be followed by "go".

  bsqldb makes use of the db-lib API provided by FreeTDS. This 
  API is of course also available to application developers.

OPTIONS
  -U username   database server login name.

  -P password   database server password.

  -S server	database server to which to connect.

  -D database	database to use.

  -i input_file  name of script file, containing SQL.

  -o output_file  name of output file, holding result data.

  -e error_file  name of file for errors.

  -v  Turn on verbose mode, for more information about the db-lib interaction.
  This also reports the result set metadata, including and return code. All
  verbose data are written to standard error (or -e), so as not to interfere 
  with the data stream.

NOTES
  bsqldb is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard output, 
  and writes errors to standard error. The -i, -o, and -e options override 
  these, of course.

  The source code for bsqldb is intended as a model for db-lib users. db-lib
  has a rich set of functions, and it can be hard sometimes to understand how to
  use them, particularly the first time. If you are using it in this way and
  find something unclear, you are encouraged to email the author your
  comments. 
  
EXIT STATUS
  bsqldb exits 0 on success, and >0 if the server cannot process the query.

  bsqldb will report any errors returned by the server, but will continue
  processing. In a production environment, this behavior may be insufficiently
  stringent. To make it extremely intolerant of errors, change the message and
  error handlers to call exit(3). 

HISTORY
  bsqldb first appeared in FreeTDS 0\.63.

AUTHORS
  The bsqldb utility was written by James K. Lowden <jklowden@schemamania.org>

BUGS
  Microsoft servers as of SQL Server 7.0 SP 3 do not return output parameters
  unless the RPC functions are used. This means bsqldb cannot return output
  parameters for stored procedures with these servers.
