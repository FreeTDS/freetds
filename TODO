This list is ordered top-to-bottom by priority.  
Things that are broken and need mending are at the top, 
followed by things that should work before the next release, 
followed by features that should be added/fixed/reworked.  

Everyone is encouraged to add to the list.  Developers can do it directly; 
anyone else can post a patch to Source Forge.  
In this way we can communicate with each
other about the project's priorities and needs.

------------
Broken:
. Fetching of CS_STATUS_RESULT result types in ctlib appears to be broken.

For 0.61 version:

For future versions:
. numeric conversions (optimize).
. move error message macro/prototype to tds.h.in; use in dblib.c.
. conversion from ucs2 to utf8, provide for 2+ bytes/character.
  (multibyte support)
. Remove old char(30) limitations to various sysnames e.g., tables, columns, 
  passwords (checks).
. Add bcp support to tds/dblib/ctlib. (started in dblib)
. Array binding for ctlib not working
. RPC stuff not implemented (work in progress, libtds ok)
. All manner of unimplemented functions
. ct_dynamic and friends needed for DBD::Sybase placeholder support 
  (work in progress)
. Server API needs more work, especially for TDS 5.0/7.0
. Add support for TDS 8.0 (login works)
. TDS 7 Unicode to native charset conversion using iconv (partly done)
. tdsping program for testing purposes
. autoconf the connection pooling stuff
. Make pool configuration a non-recompile process
. Add missing constants needed for python and verify working
. Add missing constants needed for Gnome-DB and verify working 
. Someone broke early binding in ODBC
. Autodetect TDS protocol when connecting (and cache somewhere?)
. support for VARIANT type
. set database during login process (work in progress)

(f77) Those was collected from ML...
. ODBC: get a solid corpus of unittests for ODBC, and have it become a 
  top tier API.
. DBLIB: output params (tests)
. get connection pooling working with all protocol versions
. Finish off the TDS dissector for ethereal
. ODBC: dynamic query (need rewrite SQLPrepare and related)
  (support binding parameters for all types)
. ODBC: improve, best error report (even multiple)
. dynamic query (work in progress, lack unprepare)
. cursor support
. more solid. handle out of memory conditions (started, we must test all 
  allocation and all function that return allocated data and be able to 
  rollback to a safe state)
. limit copy of data (now wire -> tds -> temp -> client)

Tests
- "if 0 = 1 select 1" should not fail
