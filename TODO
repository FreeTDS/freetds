This list is ordered top-to-bottom by priority.  
Things that are broken and need mending are at the top, 
followed by things that should work before the next release, 
followed by features that should be added/fixed/reworked.  

Everyone is encouraged to add to the list.  Developers can do it directly; anyone
else can post a patch to Source Forge.  In this way we can communicate with each
other about the project's priorities and needs.

------------
Broken:
For version 0.60:
. test conversion from char. Does libraries append blank to reach column_size ?
  same problem for binary (padded with zeroes) ?
. money conversions, maybe numerics, too.
. move error message macro/prototype to tds.h.in; use in dblib.c. 
For future versions:
. conversion from ucs2 to utf8, provide for 2+ bytes/character.
. Remove old char(30) limitations to various sysnames e.g., tables, columns, passwords.  
. Add bcp support to tds/dblib/ctlib. (started in dblib)
. Array binding for ctlib not working
. RPC stuff not implemented
. All manner of unimplemented functions
. Need a way to track problems with running apache/PHP, may have many apache 
  children going. (done, see append mode)
. ct_dynamic and friends needed for DBD::Sybase placeholder support (partly done)
. Server API needs more work, especially for TDS 5.0/7.0
. Add support for TDS 8.0 (login works)
. Domain support for MS SQL (verify)
. TDS 7 support on big endian clients (done)
. add textsize option for TDS 7 to freetds.conf (done)
. TDS 7 Unicode to native charset conversion using iconv (partly done)
. tdsping program for testing purposes
. autoconf the connection pooling stuff
. Make pool configuration a non-recompile process
. Add missing constants needed for python and verify working
. Add missing constants needed for Gnome-DB and verify working 
. Someone broke early binding in ODBC
