This list is ordered top-to-bottom by priority.  
Things that are broken and need mending are at the top, 
followed by things that should work before the next release, 
followed by features that should be added/fixed/reworked (grouped by library).  

Everyone is encouraged to add to the list.  Developers can do it directly; 
anyone else can post a patch to Source Forge.  
In this way we can communicate with each
other about the project's priorities and needs.  

To Do List	$Id: TODO,v 1.58 2003-05-25 18:03:34 freddy77 Exp $
------------
Broken:
. Undelimited data files should be read w/ tds_iconv_fread().
. src/dblib/unittests/t0017.c (bcp) is broken, perhaps for above reason.
. Change tds_get_char_data() per Frediano's suggestion, ML 2 May 2003, "tds_get_char_data and iconv".
. Rewrite tds_iconv (again):
	* use iconv() signature.
	* rely on TDSCOLINFO::iconv_info for conversion descriptor, instead 
	  of inferring it from the column sizes.  
	* On read error, emit Msg 2403, Severity 16 (EX_INFO):
		"WARNING! Some character(s) could not be converted into client's character set. Unconverted bytes were changed to question marks ('?')."
	* On write error emit Msg 2402, Severity 16 (EX_USER):
		"Error converting client characters into server's character set. Some character(s) could not be converted."
	  and return an error code.  Do not proceed.  
	* Cf. ML 16 Apr 2003. "conversion error management".
. Extend TDSSOCKET::iconv_info as an array.  Keep converters for non-UCS-2
  server charsets.  Every TDSCOLINFO holding character data should point to one of
  these elements.  
. Write functions to append to and search the TDSSOCKET::iconv_info array.  

For 0.62 version:
. add test for locale_charset() to configure.in.  Use it if available instead
  of nl_langinfo, because it implies we're using GNU iconv.  
. Walk through charset name initialization.  Make sure it works in the absence
  of an entry in freetds.conf
. Pass any internal hard-coded charset names through tds_canonical_charset_name().  
  The supporting .h file will need adjustment for non-GNU iconv.
  Input name "ASCII" must always have a canonical form.  
. Move website docs (not UG) to doc/htdoc, put in CVS
. add doc/htdoc/Makefile with "publish" target to commit cvs and update freetds.org
. drop txt2man from cvs, skip building man pages without it. 
. Rename TDS 8.0 to TDS 7.1, to be consistent with Microsoft's name
. Rationalize libtds structure and *_alloc functions (ML 5 December, sb:"names")
. ct_dynamic and friends needed for DBD::Sybase placeholder support (work in progress)
. freebcp should understand \n as newline. Also \r and \0 (null byte).

For future versions (in priority order within library):
  All:
. move error message macro/prototype to tds.h.in; use in dblib.c.
. Remove old char(30) limitations to various sysnames e.g., tables, columns, passwords (checks).  Is this done?  
. Add missing constants needed for python and verify working
  (work in progress)
. Add missing constants needed for Gnome-DB and verify working 
. conversion from ucs2 to utf8, provide for 2+ bytes/character
  (work in progress)
. tdsping program for testing purposes
. Finish off the TDS dissector for ethereal
. more solid. handle out of memory conditions (started, we must test all allocation and all function that return allocated data and be able to rollback to a safe state)
. optimize numeric conversions (partial)
. limit copy of data (now wire -> tds -> temp -> client)
  use a method like zero-copy
. All manner of unimplemented functions (see doc/api_status.txt)
. cursor support
. tds_connect free tds structure on failure. This cause in some condition
  a pointer to garbage in some library (workaround written, best to change)
. support for named instances under mssql2k
. portability: Tru64 64bit (reported core)
. dynamic query: port code for string building from ODBC to libtds
  (required for some test working using tds4.2)
. Autodetect TDS protocol when connecting (and cache somewhere?)
. support for VARIANT type (never requested, only for completeness)


  db-lib
. Returning INT_CANCEL from an error handler doesn't always engender FAIL. 

  ct-lib
. cs_calc and cs_cmp, for sybperl
. DBD::Sybase uses the ct_command(CS_RPC_CMD) and ct_param()
. ct_get/send_data()
. ct_option() calls (CS_OPT_ROWCOUNT, CS_OPT_TEXTSIZE, among others)
. Array binding for ctlib not working
. async function, async calls (dbpoll() and friends)
. bcp support to ctlib
. support all type of bind in ct_bind (CS_VARBINARY_TYPE and other)
  search "site:.sybase.com CS_VARBINARY ct_bind" on google for more info
. support ct_command/CS_SEND_DATA_CMD, now crash
  (see http://manuals.sybase.com/onlinebooks/group-cn/cng1000e/ref/@Generic__BookTextView/50456)
. complete sqlstate and other field in message (for Python)

  odbc
. dynamic query (need rewrite SQLPrepare and related) (support binding parameters for all types) (work in progress)
. cursor support
. Star Office complains that these TypeInfo constants are not implemented in SQLGetInfo:
	47      SQL_USER_NAME
  (handle environment callbacks)
  do a "SELECT USER_NAME()". If data pending MS do another connection with 
  same login.
. Star Office complains "Statement option 109" is not implemented in SQLGetConnectOption.
. test: SQLPutData/SQLGetData
. test: check for SQLGetTypeInfo (test column names in versions 2 and 3 
  of odbc, varchar/nvarchar should be before sysname, numeric type for data 
  with different odbc versions)
. SQLNativeSql and fill SQLGetInfo according (mssql7+ handle odbc escapes 
  directly)
. autoinstall for RPM

  pool
. get connection pooling working with all protocol versions
. Make pool configuration a non-recompile process

  server
. Server API needs more work, especially for TDS 5.0/7.0

Tests
- "if 0 = 1 select 1" should not fail

Done (removed from above):
. Add doxygen to the nightly build
. "make install" should put the UG in PREFIX/share/doc/freetds/userguide
. "make install" should put doxygen html in PREFIX/share/doc/freetds/reference
. Add bcp support to tds/dblib/ctlib. (started in dblib)
. RPC stuff not implemented (work in progress, libtds ok)
. Add support for TDS 8.0 (login works)
. TDS 7 Unicode to native charset conversion using iconv (partly done)
. autoconf the connection pooling stuff
. DBLIB: output params (tests)
. set database during login process
. libtds: dynamic query
. ctlib: null returns zero-length string(see "SELECT '' and TDS 7.0" in message list on 26 Jan 2003)

Done in 0.62
. ODBC: improve, best error report (finish and test, see error.c FIXME and TODO)
. ct-lib: support ct_diag (for Python)
. ODBC test: how work mssql driver using SQLMoreResults/SQLRowCount and batch 
  like SELECT INSERT INSERT SELECT ?
  (SQLMoreResults skip row counts for INSERT?)
. ODBC: Check (and fix if needed) call to {?=store(?)} does it bind correctly?
  seem not replace first parameters
. ODBC test: what happen on:
  - "select id,name from sysobjects where name = 'sysobjects'"
  - SQLMoreResults
  - SQLMoreResults 
. Someone broke early binding in ODBC 
  (fixed, add check for early bind, and multiple recordset)
. ODBC: configure should detect iODBC or unixODBC automatically
